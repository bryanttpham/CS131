* I overlooked the instruction that told me to save terminal history 
1. Created ssh key on remote server 
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

1. Added ssh key in github 

2. Created github repository in github 

3. SSH cloned repository onto remote server 
git clone git@github.com:bryanttpham/CS131.git

4. cd CS132

5. touch bryant.txt

6. Edited bryant.txt on github 


Next time I'll create the github repository on the remote server and then ill push/create new repository on github 
I'll also make changes to files through cli as well
