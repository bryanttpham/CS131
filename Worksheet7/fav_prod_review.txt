Why would anyone take breastfeedg advice from a man who is not even a parent  medically traed f that matter? Thk about this people- would you ask your mechanic to deliever your baby  to set your broken arm? To listen to someone wh no medical experience is sane I have 3 children- a sgleton  tws - all FORMULA FED  they started sleepg on their own all through the night- wh 2 weeks of birth- WITHOUT THIS BOOK! This book endses tturg fants Babies are not bn wh conscious thoughts of selfishness as MrEzzo is tryg to say- They cry because they are hungry! F Goodness sakes- Feed your babies when they are hungry  befe takg any buffoons parentg advise- please consult your pediatrican A good pot is to remember that people are not always scheduled- most adults are not- how can you attempt to program a child when to be? It would not be fair to do this to your baby Please try another book- \\"what to expect when your expectg\\"  \\"What to expect the first year\\" is excellent  unbiased
Another bad baby book that promotes emotional DETATCHMENTThis book is a danger to children everywhereDr ezzo claims that babies do not remember beg left to cryHogwashI remember clearly  have been deeply traumatised f leI now suffer from permanent sleep disders  fear of the dark as well as a lack of emotional attatchment to my parentsI read this book purely out of curiosyI was stunned at the coldness of this so-called christian manMy babies were rocked to sleep then laid down beside me right where God tended f babies to beMy children go to sleep easily whout issue fact they were sleepg through the night by 2 weeks of ageCo-sleepg is the only healthy means of raisg childrenThis book is a throwback to the cold harsh victian era where selfish parents put themselves first  focused on trag children like they are wild animalsI py any child who is put through the riggs of this hrible bookAvoid this book like the plague

I have read others reviews  they are very negative  I have a 15 1/2 month old son who has been sleepg through the night sce he was 9 WEEKS old thanks to this book  Schedules are very obviously a GREAT thg f babies b/c they always know what to expect  thus become happy  well adjusted babies  My son is happy go lucky  has great sleepg habs  I plan to utilize the tools wh my son Jakob who is due  July 2005 as well!!!!

On Becomg Babywise is a useful tool f parents  I tell my friends who are expectg that one of the greatest gts I have given my children is teachg them to sleep (refreshed-ready to learn laugh  play) My three sons slept through the night by eight weeks ( still do)  seemed to truly enjoy their nap times My youngest is four months old He wakes up from his nap  night time sleep by coog I go to his room  am greeted by a large toothless gr He is a very happy  pleasant baby He was over 9 lbs at birth  is nearly 18lbs now He has a beautul complextion bright eyes  a quick smile I am not wrg this to defend myself agast the crazed rantgs of some of the other reviewers (I would have been okay  they'd simply disagreed wh the book but to imply that those who use the book are heartless child abusers is way over the top) I am wrg  to let expectant parents  those who struggle wh children who won't sleep know that I have used this book  applied s prciples (wh love  patience not cold-hearted cruelty) f all three of my children  have had excellent results
This book was a lesaver f my family  Like many others I took what was wrten wh a gra of salt  used common sense to apply the methods discribed  Wh 48 hours of readg this book my 6 week old daughter was sleepg  eatg better  my husb  I were fally able to get some sleep  The PDF schedule wked very well f my daughter  she is a wonderfully healthy  happy 1 year old today
The methods  this book can be very dangerous to your baby Do any ternet search on Gary Ezzo  you will fd hr sties of po babies that have been PYHSICALLY harmed by these methods The American Academy of Pediactrics are agast these methods

Read the effects of fcg an fant to a feedg/sleepg schedule by \\"cryg  out\\"  as wrien by Dr Sears who is a REAL doct unlike Ezzo who has NO credentials of any kd  If this doesn't break your heart I don't know what will

I read the reviews  thk wow everyone is so PROUD that their child sleeps through the night at 6 weeks 7 weeks 3 weeks But at what price did that ltle bundle have to pay? Just you want  see You were so concerned wh gettg your child to sleep through the night that you read this book  praticed what  preached You manipulated  fced your child to a schedule by depravg her of the two thgs  depends on THE MOST COMFORT  FOOD And yes  wked There were other ways to do  but you used a method that would be deemed as humane  you did  to an adult  even a dog But see how your child develops EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY becuase of   then maybe you will realize what so many docts teachers parenrs are tryg to expose These methods are wrong Yes a route can help create a me secure child but so does comft love  nution! A child under 3 months cannot  should not be fced to a route! Those are the MOST crical months  can be the most damagg His book is not endsed by ANY pediatric counsel  is discouraged by many docts associations teachers  even followers of his fah So go ahead follow his prcipal  don't feed your fant on dem just let her cry  do not console her - sure she'll eventually stop  you may thk you have discipled her But what you have taught her stead is that no one is comg to comft her  therefe she has given up hope Somethg that WILL effect her  future realtionships There are HUNDREDS OF REAL cases of FTT (failure to thrive) dehydration weight loss  damagg mental effects of wakg a sleepg baby  not feedg on dem just to get them on a schedule And wakg a sleepg fant under 3 months somethg that you should never ever do - ASK ANY DOCTOR It effects their mental growth! Babies grow when SLEEP! Thats' how their ltle bras develop! They need to eat on dem f the first three months of le there ltle bodiesh so many growth spurts durg that time that the need food to fuel ! You are just deprivg them of NUTRITION needed to grow! You can create comftable \\"routes\\" when the are old enough to actually underst mentally what a route is not befe But don't take my wd f  follow the preachgs of Ezzo who does not even have credentials  child development healthcare breastfeedg  baby care n does he have an undergraduate degree So hurray f you that your baby sleeps through the night there were other ways to do  - but  you enfced such practices as outled  his book see what emotional  mental ramications will come of   the end []
Oh NO!!!!!  Can't believe Amazon is still sellg this Medieval tture manual  EVERY reputable source has denounced Ezzo  his cult of md numbed followers  Babies have DIED because of this man  If you need kdlg f your fire this might be useful  you need to le the lter box f kty then mmmmmabyeI'd check the absbency of the paper first Maybe that book by Maureen Dowd would be better f that ZERO STARSnegative one million stars  And maybe one Chese throwg starembedded  Ezzo's neck
This is an outstg book  wks f sgletons  multiples  It walks you through how to get your child to eat &amp sleep through the night  By eight weeks our baby slept through the night!  She is a good sleeper napper eater  Thus is well-rested  so are we  She has never had digestive problems learns  her parent/fant class -- all which I attribute to this program  Everyone who has not used Babywise has commented on how well adjusted our baby is  My friends that have used Babywise just respond wh an &quotI told you so&quot as their children are equally well-adjusted  Many friends wh multiples have used this program successfully  Fget Sears  some of those other child experts Our nephew was raised via Dr Sears  at 3 years has never slept through the night still sleeps wh his parents  is a very why codependent child
I fd  hard to believe the offense people might take to this book  some of the reviews offerred I do believe there are multiple ways to raise an fant/ toddler- but I thk we can all agree as parents that a route is the most imptant established step  raisg a healthy child After 8 weeks of child dem feedgas recommended by every lactation specialist I spoke wh resultg  2-3 hours of colicky behavi a day feedg schedules that mimicked once an hour feedgs  the mng  at night I realized that proper feedg techniques are essential I had an excellent latcher-  a wonderful &quotsnacker&quot on my hs-but not a baby who knew how to eat efficiently Volume wasn't a problem-  I didn't md feedg him 12 times a day wh no me than 3 hours of sleep at a time at night at 8 weeks I just felt as a mother that by 2 months babies should be sleepg me along the les of 4-5 hour stretches by then That is when my PEDIATRICIAN recommended this book by Gary Ezzo-  wh 72 hours of startg the schedule at 8 weeks of age- my baby was sleepg 7 hours through the night WHAT A GODSEND! My baby is happy thrivg growg immensely  frankly has absolutely no fussy periods  the day at all Even his bowel movements are me regular less gassy  he wets 8-10 diapers a day so hydration is not a fact f us I thk we can all agree that dferent routes wk f dferent babies-  as mother's we have to try on many dferent &quotroute hats&quot to fd what wks f our own children But to irately state that this is &quot child abuse &quot by one reviewer is offensive to the mother's out there whose babies do well wh this schedule I highly recommend this book  schedule to any mother willg to try somethg new  what they have isn't wkg At 12 weeks- I have a bright happy energetic  beautul 14lb baby- who has doubled his birth weight already  he has two parents who are rested  ready to meet his energy dem In fact my nephew is 15 weeks-  not &quotbabywise&quot  is still only sleepg 4 hours at a time  while he was bigger by a full pund at birth- he is now a pound down versus his cous
I read this book at the suggestion of a friend though I was wary when I read some negative reviews such as are seen here on Amazon  I was que surprised by how much sense the book makes  light of charges of child abuse  I followed the ma guideles of this book wh my son also beg flexible to his needs (as the book suggests)  he was a well adjusted well rested successfully breastfed baby  Aga I'm not sure where charges of child abuse come  sce the ma premise of the book is to help children breastfeed me successfully to achieve weight ga by nursg on fat  calie rich hd milk stead of fe milk  to sleep better by achievg a regular schedule  Every parent knows that babies are creatures of hab  this book helps foster successful habs  Just as parents don't let their toddlers eat cy all day  let their six year olds watch tv to their heart's content this book helps parents of fants set a route to benef their development  Every person I've ever recommended this book to has had great success  The track recd of me fant-centered approaches (let the baby dictate what they want when they want )has not been so successful  my experience  Rather this book helps parents anticipate what babies need  when they need   Don't listen to flammaty crics  Read  judge f yourself  I thk you'll be pleasantly surprised as was I
I bought this book thkg that  showed some new technique to help babies sleep  I was amazed wh the ideas  the book  Lettg a baby cry to sleep  let the baby sleep  s vom is surely abuse  My son sleeps 12 hours straight every night  has no problems takg naps but he never cried to sleep  The book went to the trash as soon as I was fished readg   My son is well adjusted  wh patience  route he learned to calmly go to bed after our bedtime rual a book  a song  We have the same route sce he was a newbn he knows we will be by his side  he cries he knows we love him  because of that he sleeps peacefully  New parents be aware that lettg your baby cry is not the solution to sleepless nights  Trust yourselves not a hrible book  Love your kids do not tture them  Kids need love  consistence
Everyone wants a good night's sleep but this is no answer  He offers the seductive idea that your le can be like  was befe you had a baby--predictable dered-- while this may  may not be true this is a cruel way to effect that end
Most medical professionals will tell you that the feedg methods described by Ezzo can be harmful to an fants physical  emotional health  Carried to an extreme these methods can  have led to death  If you decide to use these techniques anyway please be extremely careful  Be honest wh your pediatrician about your feedg schedule (don't lie b/c you thk he/she won't like )   your baby isn't gag weight looks dehydrated is extremely fussy  shows any other signs of illness get your baby to the ER  choose another method  Realize that there are other ways of raisg kids God's way
When my first daughter came home from the hospal I had no idea how to schedule her how much she should drk  how much she should sleep  I was a wreck  She was bottle fed  did not sleep through the night until she was 3 years old  her baby sister was on the way  It was hrible fally havg to realize that she would have just cry herself to sleep at the age of three  I had friends whose babies slept perfectly  ate perfectly  The one thg they all had  common was Babywise  Wh a new baby on the way I vowed to do everythg dferent  I read Babywise cover to cover several times befe my 2nd daughter was bn I nursed her  followed the book as close as I could  It was amazg She did everythg the book said she would do She was sleepg from 7pm to 7am by 15 weeks  Naps were not an issue She would just go down at the scheduled time  She is now 5  we are expectg sister number 3  I've given away my copy of Babywise as well as purchased copies f my friends  family  I am about to buy myself another copy so that I will be refreshed when my new daughter gets her  a few months!
Common sense cannot salvage this book There are too many erroneous medical claims too many documented case studies of babies who have failed to thrive  too many confusg pieces of advice  one does as Ezzo suggests  a few places  this book to appease his crics  just &quotfeeds a hungry baby&quot then what is the pot of the schedule  the first place Don't waste your time  risk your baby's health wh this book If you accept all the &quot wked f me&quot claims at least consider the &quot didn't wk f me&quot statements too
My sister--law followed the guideles  this book  was rewarded wh a baby needg to be hospalized because she wasn't gettg enough food If you want to know exactly what not to do to your baby this book is the one to read Just do the exact oppose of what he recommends  your baby will thrive
I can't say enough good thgs about this book! I tell everyone I know who is havg a baby how well the babywise schedulg wks  Our baby is 8 months old now  she has been sleepg through the night sce 10 weeks old  It just happened just like the book said  wouldThank you Babywise!
I exclusively breastfed my daughter f a year  she started sleepg through the night at 10 weeks  At 2 1/2 she contues to sleep through the night  wake up happy  I owe a lot of  to Babywise After readg a few books  articles my husb  I chose to implement the Babywise method I also just fished readg Childwise f my older daughter  plan on implementg Gary Ezzo's theies once aga!  His books are easy to read simple to follow  quick to wk
It is the only book you need to guide you along those first months  My son cried nonstop the first week  my sister sent me this book  It just makes sense as babies must have a route  Never wake a sleepg baby!!!!  It's true  wh 2 weeks I had a wonderful child who was happy  sleepg so much better  I loved the schedule  the back as any Mom  Dad knows you are just exhausted  this was an valuable reference  I also loved the guideles on where your baby should be at every 3 mo terval  I gave  to my cous who had tws  she too agreed  helped her so much  My new daughter was sleepg 10 hrs a night by 7 weeks  She was  a route wh 2 weeks  is dog just great  We're all a happy well-rested family!
Any parent should take advantage of the skills this book has to offer Our new baby after only 4 nights began to sleep through the night EVERY night Once you make  past the first stage of changg their biological clocks  is wth all the efft!This helped my we  I so much the wd is out at our office of 30000 employees Everyone is jog  the new rest  peace this book offers
I have been suprised at what I have been readg  reference to Ezzo's book ON BECOMING BABYWISE  My daughter is now three months old  She started sleepg through the night (7 hours) at six weeks  now she is sleepg ten hours  I have read some reviews sayg your baby might be starvg  you use Ezzo's approach  Well not my daughter!  She came to this wld at 5lbs  she weighs a woppg 12lbs now!!!This is a great book  has helped my husb  I to get the sleep we need too!!!
As new parents my husb  I have greatly benefted from this book We know tons of families who have used this program  we have been able to watch these PDF children grow up to be the most well-behaved baby's/toddlers / kids I have ever seenAs a fmer Nanny I have seen first h parents who dem fed their children  raised them  a \\"dem\\" st of way- the majy of these children were why spoiled brats who ran their household The PDF children I know who come from a variety of dferent types of families are me patient dependent well mannered  self reliant than any children I have ever seen Seeg this evidence  these kids made we ask- \\"how did you tra your children to be so GOOD all the time??\\"  everyone's answer was  started wh Babywise My husb  I have used the ideas suggested  this book  we have a very happywell nourished 3 month old son who sleeps 10 hours a night is able to enterta himself durg playtimes as well as joyfully teract wh us  puts himself to sleep at naps  bedtime wh ltle to no fussg  no sleep props I am not sayg that this philosophy of parentg is \\"how  SHOULD be done\\"- but  our personal experience  personal wness of other children traed this way  is wth a read Contrary to other review's-  does not promote igng your child  denyg him what he needs but teaches you to recognize his needs me accurately  der to be a better parent I love the fact that this auth wres about welcomg your child to the family un-  not centerg the family un around your child Which happens all to often wh Dem Parentg- baby calls the shots babywise teaches moms  dads to tra the children to be a part of the family  not to revolve the family around the child I love my son  am overwhelmed by the blessg that he is  he is a humongous part of my le now but he is not my entire le i Thk any mom  dad whois overwhelmed by constant feedgs  lack of sleep  a general angst over \\" what am I dog?\\" would greatly benef from this book
This book is great! Not only does  emphasize a schedule to help mom  baby but  also helps emphasize daily bondg time based on parent child teraction not bondg based on proximy of the parent Many of the bad reviews of this book are high advocates of attachment parentg  feel that anythg other than their way of parentg is wrong I would strongly encourage all parents to read this book  the other \\"On Becomgwise\\" books They are a great parentg philosophy that allows the child to become a wonderful dividual as well as a wonderful new addion to any family
If you have a newbn wh jaundice  days  nights mixed up then Babywise is required readg  Do not read  befe the baby is bn  It will make no sense  Also do not let moms  mothers--law read the book  It will make perfect sense to them as they have fgotten what  is like to survive on mutes of sleep at a time  will frequently ask you  you are \\"followg the schedule\\"  The auths are sht  to the pot which is good because so is your patience after three weeks of round-the-clock feedgs  In fact you will probably throw Babywise away once  twice because you are sick of their stupid schedules  personal antecdotes but hopefully like me you will retrieve the book befe trash day      The best advice I picked up from Babywise is that  your baby wakes up cryg from a nap then they have not slept long enough  Peek through the do  you have to but let them wk themselves back to sleep  One of my many mistakes was to run  durg naptime  assume that because my baby was cryg naptime must be over  I wish my sister--law had not thrown her Babywise book out  Her child is now ten months  is still wakg up twice a night f feedgs  comftg I kicked that hab at 3 months
I was totally exhausted wh my baby's feedg every 2-3 hours  rarely sleepg me than a 2 hour stretch I knew I needed help  checked out 4 books from the library on baby's  sleep problems I recommend all of them  especially On Becomg Babywise It is truly a common sense approach The other books that helped me are:Also  the claims some of these reviews make are true that Dr Ezzo has been excommunicated from his church I believe the claims are suspect If the claime are at all true any kd of church controversy would not at all be related to the wonderful parentg advice given  his book
I heard great thgs about this book  thought I needed  to get my baby to sleep well  Not true  I did buy the book but didn't even read  completely  My (fmula fed) baby ate every 3-4 hours  slept completely through the night at 8 weeks  Even after 3 weeks he only got up to eat  then went right back to sleep  I thk as long as you establish a route you will be fe  do not need any books
When we followed the techniques  this book our baby daughter began sleepg through the night at 6 weeks old  She is now 18 months old  I can count the number of times she has woken up durg the night sce week 6 on one hParentg isn't easy but couplg this book wh your stcts will likely lead to a happy baby  happy confident  rested parents
I agree wh all the other reviews the book is helpful but you need to follow your own stcts as well  The one key thg that Ezzo recommends is flexible schedules  A baby doesn't have a schedule f their first few months  rather than puttg my baby to bed when I felt he should sleep I put his to bed when he needed    eventually fell to a pattern  The first few weeks feedg were rough especially wh a baby that has reflux  But I paid attention to my baby  learned to figure out why he is cryg rather than offerg him food every time  That was the most helpful advice from the book  Ezzo also talks about dferent stages that your baby will go through  that helps as well  I learned f myself contrary to the book that  my son fell asleep  the swg  somewhere else f the first few weeks  was alright  The most imptant thg was that he got the sleep that he needed  But by his fourth month he learned that his crib was f sleepg  thgs got much better after that  The pot is go wh your gut   Follow advice that feels right but   doesn't then do what does!
I read this book because  was recommended to me by several people  was not impressed by Ezzo's advice  Me than anythg else you need to follow your own stcts as a parent  Although I'm sure my daughter won't remember the hrible weeks where I tried to fce consistent naps on her I will --  I've learned to follow her cues better but me imptantly to trust myself first  femost  We as parents spend me time wh our children than anyone else  we know me than we thk we do
I got this book about 2 months after my oldest son was bn Some say  wks better f fmula fed babies but my son was breastfed   wked great He was always a chubby baby  mataed that look through this trag He thrived! The key  this book is the general \\"route\\" that is endsed Eat play sleep eat  so on My son slept through the night by 2  a half months old ate well played well  is overall a great result from usg this book as a guide to your route Ideally you want the schedule to be a 3 hour cycle but ially of course  is not as long sce younger babies obviously need me feedgs than older ones That's fe -- use your stcts  adjust the schedule time as your baby's needs dicate Many AP parents slam this book but I thk the trouble comes from followg ANY book to the letter This is a good framewk wh which to regulate your days  stcts don't get igned  don't want them to be There is no advocation of starvg your child f the sake of schedule -- depse what many AP parents seem to thk It clearly says that by all means  baby is hungry feed him! My son started off eatg every 15 hours  we still used this plan wh that time he gradually wked up to 3  then 4 hours per \\"cycle\\" as he grew DO NOT follow any book to the letter All books are skewed by opions of the wrers  what wked f them may not wk f you f whatever reason yours  the baby's But the framewk  logic is sound  my opion  adaptable to su the needs of your household One thg that I didn't like was the book does not encourage a lot of holdg your baby -- I thk that should have been emphasized me Babies need to be held  loved on when they are awake  sce they are beg taught a b of dependence  their sleep there's no need to whold the affection  their wakg time Spoil them wh love!!
I wish I had known befe I bought this book that the American Academy of Pediatrics  most baby experts are strongly opposed to the methods  this book It goes agast all natural stcts you have to care f your baby  stead teaches rigid schedules that are convenient f the parent regardless of the babys needs I did me research on this befe followg   found that some babies actually have to be hospalized when the parents follow the feedg advice sce they are undernourished I was really hopg to fd good fmation on gettg my baby to sleep but s only a small part of the book anyway  not very good ideas at that (put your baby  the crib  let him cry) I ended up throwg this book away  buyg a me compassionate one called The No-Cry Sleep Solution My baby  I are both much happier
It's absolutely hrible  Why would any parent deny their fants cries?  Babies don't cry to manipulate their parents - they cry because they NEED somethg  They need comft  closeness just as much as they need food  I do not recommend any parent follow anythg this book has to say  All  teaches  f parents to deny their natural sticts to pick up  care f their cryg baby   teaches babies to distrust their parents  Of course babies will stop cryg  fall asleep after beg left to cry  out - they are exhausted  scared  Would you let your husb/we/partner cry f mutes  hours on end whout gog to comft them? then why do  to your helpless fant?
I read Babywise when I was pregnant wh my son  Because I have Fibromyalgia  am a very light sleeper I was concerned that I'd never get any sleep aga  Although that was my concern I couldn't believe the atrocious method of \\"convenient parentg\\" I came across  this book!!  I gave  away to someone to read f her second child (out of her terest  why I was so disgusted)  I should have burned If you do read this book make sure you read many many other books too -  talk to really experienced lovg  patient parents  It is as cold as the Victian adage \\"children should be seen  not heard\\"  How about just NOT havg children then?!! a recipe f disaster is what  is!
I read \\"Babywise\\" befe each of my children were bn  Both of them were sleepg through the night (an average 10 hours) at 6 weeks of age  Yes the schedule the auths suggest does wk If gettg your child to sleep is your goal this is the book f you
I'm a parent of six children  the system described  this book does wk
There is controversy surroundg this book ( case  wasn't obvious) Clearly there are dferent parentg practices based on various philosphical prejudices  presupposions as to how babies best \\"operate\\" As a new parent I read babywise about 4 times   just pla wks f some people (many five star ratgs are entled: \\"It Really Wks!\\"  somethg to that affect) But there are some problems too F example Ezzo lays thgs out as \\"the way thgs are\\" whout a lot of room f conflictg studies Yes there are well researched studies that demonstrate contrary \\"facts\\" regardg babies sleepg schedules feedgs  so fth Let me suggest three steps toward better discernment befe one is prone to leap at this book  a f of sleepless exhaustion lookg f the cure -- the quick-fixPuttg baby on a route is great Creatg a sense of consistency  the household which a vulnerable fant can depend on f a sense of secury is fe Just don't get one book  follow  like an owner's manual f babies as though they were a Sears appliance Ezzo is wrong about some thgs  my ma red flag from his book is the lack of fthcomgness ( awareness perhaps?)  humily about other perspectives He also raises some excellent pots that are wth considerg  balance wh other views Wth readg but not alone!
I was given this book as a baby shower gt  Why I have no idea It is  the garbage now  This book is TOTALLY anti-attachement  very ANTI baby  you ask me
The people who have wrten negative reviews have the concepts of the book all wrong  There's no way they could have read the whole thg thoughly  gotten the impressions they did  This book teaches you that 1)Full feedgs are imptant f the baby 2)Babies can go to sleep on their own  you give them the chance  3)You should not always assume your baby is hungry just because  cries  It does not tell you to whold food unless  has been 4 hours sce the last feedg that is a false statement another reviewer wrote  It tells you that you should get to know your baby well enough so that you as a parent can decide what  needs  give  to your baby  And  stresses that  you asess your baby  thk  is hungry by all means defely feed the baby no matter how long  has been sce the last feedg  And  does not tell you to be unresponsive to your baby's emotional needs - the whole concept is to be able to decide what your baby needs  give  exactly that  We've been usg the book's teachgs only a few weeks  parents  baby are happier  healthier already
I am a day care provider who read this book because a baby  my care was on the baby wise plan The auth has lots of good pots about havg a good maral relationship wh your spouse but as far as his parentg philosophy:teachg an 8 week old to eat every 4 hours  sleep all through the night is absurd! The book is anti-bondg  Ezzo's philosophy is to not hold the baby too much because he  she will become spoiled The ltle boy I watch is 4 months old  a nervous wreck I suppose the parents are happy because he DOES sleep through the night but he is not a very happy baby He is lethargic cranky (He still cries  screams 3 hours after eatg) His parents come to pick him up  he doesn't smile at them  doesn't even look them  the eye! His mother wants us to keep him awake 2 hours after a feedg to \\"play\\" but he is so grouchy he usually cries f 15 mutes  then falls asleepIt makes me sad that this is happeng all over I wouldn't recommend  to ANYONE!
A co-wker of me recommended this book to me after I had not slept me than 4 hours at a time  6 weeks  I was convced my daughter had somnia  She never slept me than 30 mutes at a time durg the day  only f one four hour stretch at night ( that was a good night)  After readg this book  usg 's schedule my daughter started takg regular 15 hour naps throughout the day  sleepg at least 6 hours through the night  This book is very easy readg  speaks  very pla terms  The basic philosophy is to teach your child how to eat regularly (not snack)  establish healthy sleep patterns (whout the use of props such as swgs rockg etc)  I had to learn to listen to my baby cry  her crib f a while so that she learned to fall asleep on her own but the payoff was a much happier me content baby durg her wakg hours  a mom who felt  control  well rested enough to actually sg  play wh her baby  It's a must f all new moms
We heard about the book Becomg BabyWise  liked the concept  It is an amazg book that helped our new ltle baby sleep through the night at 8 weeks old! The book gives you guideles to help them learn to fall asleep on their own The pattern they teach is to feed your baby then play wh them (even  's only f 2 mutes when they're br new)  then to put them to sleep  They encourage the reader to pay attention to the cues from the baby  to make sure they are hungry befe automatically feedg them every time they cry It's so helpful to get on a schedule (that the parent not the baby sets)  our ltle one quickly got to a great route!  This book was a lesaver  I recommend  to every new parent!
Our childbirth class struct dismissed this book entirely  then had to confess that she'd never even read ! I read this book several times befe our daughter arrived  still keep  close f quick reference My mother a lab  delivery nurse f 30 years also read   said \\"this is mostly just good common sense\\" She also told me what I want to share wh others: you will become the expert on your baby So read good books like this one consider how you feel about what you read  be willg to try the general prciples outled  this book We didn't always follow the Baby Wise guideles   didn't feel right  wasn't a good f f our baby but she did sleep through the night at 8 weeks of age  has done so consistently sce week 10 Perhaps even better is her abily to put herself to sleep  the way she truly enjoys beg  her crib I believe the methods described  this book have helped us raise a healthy happy content baby who knows what she can expect from a consistent route  trusts us completely Don't be fooled by people like our struct who say that the book promotes fundamentalist Christiany (I found no references whatsoever)  puts the parents' needs ahead of the child's Neher judgment could be further from the truth
A friend of me recommended this book when I was 3 months pregnant the ideas trigued my husb  I so we decided to buy the book  give the techniques a try  It was the best thg we could've done f our child!!  At 13 weeks old our daughter sleeps 9 to 10 hours a night  has been sleepg throughout the night from the very moment we brought her home  F any one who is a new parent  would like some great advice don't listen to those who have overreacted  some of these reviews give Baby Wise a try  you will NOT be disappoted
Parentg is credibly arduous--especially the first year  But just as we do not feed a newbn a piece of steak  expect them to walk over  pick up their bottle we should remember not to have unrealistic developmental expectations wh regards to sleep eher  If an fant is cryg whether f physical  f--just as valid--emotional needs the parent should respond to those needs  Ezzo's program does a disservice to fants f the sake of parental convenience  Even his language shows his confusion between children  pets Like most parents we found the first year to be just as demg  exhaustg as  was rewardg  remarkable  Our 19-month-old is an engaged quisive  smart toddler who sleeps well  is thrivg happily  Parents are amazed at her age because her poise confidence  secury are dicative of a much older child  Ftunately we avoided _Babywise's_ advice  chose to priize her needs to ours  After all who's the adult here?
My son is five years old now so I can tell you from five years of experience that this book wks!  We followed the guideles from the moment our son was bn   was great  Of course I had some problems beg a first-time mother but the schedulg really helped me  I was able to discern what my child was cryg f durg the day  If he started beg fussy most times I realized  was close to his naptime  he was ready to go down  This schedule helped me to bond wh my baby  I knew when he was gog to be most alert  therefe the best time to play sg  read to him  I knew when he would be hungry  therefe when I could make a trip to the grocery ste  bank  he slept through the night at 4 weeks!!!    This book will help you be a better parent  know what your child really needs  Give  a try  see f yourself!!!
This book was a gt from a friend who swe up  down that  proved successful  gettg a child to sleep through the night  as few as 8 weeks  Based on that testament alone I dove   As a woman expectg my first child I have to adm that I'm scared to death of the sleepless nights  zombie-like days that I feel are sure to afflict me  the weeks ahead  I absolutely plan to follow the guideles (not RULES guideles) that are established  this book
This book should be outlawedIt freightens me that so many women do not trust their natural stcts  that of their newbn babies  Babies who learn that they cannot rely on their very own mothers f what they need tend to become secure aggressive  freightened adults who do not fully comprehend the depths of love compassion  selfless livg  Ezzo seems to be a fearful man who cannot comprehend the imptance of the mother-child bond  all the benefs that accompany breastfeedg on dem ( does not wk any other way) child wearg  co-sleepg  He fosters de-tachment parentg  the rest of our society will suffer when the \\"Ezzo\\" children grow up to become violent  fearful aggresss  Mothers don't need experts they have love  tuion  Ezzo disregards the imptance of a mother's true role  the birth of a family
I had my son a year ago  I have to say that this book was a le saver  Beg a new mom I had everyone tellg me somethg dferent  I read a few books  when my friend gave me this book  made sense  She used  f her children  strongly recommended   I read   what a relief from day one Puttg my child on a schedule that cocided wh me was what I needed  I could plan my day I knew when he would take a nap would eatI didn't have to guess anyme  I would strongly recommend this book f any new mother
The book isn't extremist  I wasn't aware that the auths were even religious until someone told me laterI recommend the book  Read - follow   you like  Use part all  none of   Have fun
Readg some of the anti-postgs about this book I can't help but conclude that many (most?) of the anti-reviewers here haven't actually read the book  The book isn't extremist  I wasn't aware that the auths were even religious until someone told me laterI recommend the book  Read - follow   you like  Use part all  none of   Have fun
Although some of the ideas represented  this book are \\"tough love\\" ideas  would not appeal to the \\"attachment parentg crowd\\" the basic concept of schedulg wks Fdg your baby's schedule (eatg sleepg wake time)  learng your baby's cues are crical f success  gettg your baby to sleep It also helps both you  your baby \\"learn\\" to breastfeed As a new parent wh no clue where to beg I found this book very helpful  approached  a flexible way Many of my friends who had children befe this book was available are amazed to wness my husb  I put our son down to sleep whout a peep
I read this book while I was pregnant  had no idea of the challenges of a new baby I thought the auths did a good job of discussg  explag the evolution of child-rearg they At times they got a ltle too detailed perhaps but overall I appreciated understg how they arrived at their viewpot  the babywise methods Overall I thought this book was a wonderful help  would suggest any new parent read 
I can't believe this book  It's so sad to me that people would read this book  thk 's a good way to teract wh your baby the most precious  vulnerable thg  the wld  Hopefully people have children to love them  be part of their family  Havg your child sleep through the night by eight weeks shouldn't be your primary objective  Raisg a healthy well adjusted  happy baby should be your objective  It just shows how out of whack our society is  And people wonder why we have so many social problems  It's because we value sleep  convienience over the well-beg of our children  We value time  front of the TV over time wh our babies  It is truly sad  If you're lookg f compassionate yet balanced views on parentg  babies look to some books by Dr Sears  Other good books are \\"Attachment Parentg\\" \\"Val Touch\\"  \\"Our Babies Ourselves\\" That's where you will truly fd the answer
HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!This book encourages parents to igne their babies cries thus teachg them that no one will respond to their needs  Yah they probably *will* stop cryg after a while!  They'll eventually figure out you're not gog to come soothe them  feed them  Dont you thk that fancy is a ltle early f such harsh treatment??  I do  It's a fact that babies rely on their parents f just about all of their emotional needs  They need us to make them feel safe  secure  This book teaches babies that their needs are second to ours no exceptions  It is frightengly remiscent of pet trag manuals  Hey babies are people too!  Give them a break already!  Give them a hug  rock them back to sleep!  Ezzo actually teaches DISCIPLINE  this book  If you still have to buy to his vile cruel method please at least igne the disciple segment  There is NEVER a good reason to h a baby  (Ezzo describes how to smack an fant on the thighs to avoid leavg marks no joke)  
Yeah Yeah all those folks out there who say 's harsh didn't take what the pricipals were  apply them wh heart!  Six couples w/ 7 babies all sleepg thru the night from 7 to 10 weeks is testiment enough ( two babies were breastfed tws!)  Buy the follow up books too!  Our child now speaks & uses her sign language at the same time
This book is a lesaver!  The ideal of Parent Directed Feedgs reads like common sense  I don't know why there is so much controversy over this issue  This book teaches how to start a flexible schedule while still respondg to the cues of your baby  My daughter is now eight months old  has been sleepg contentedly through the night sce she was ne weeks old  This book saved my le
It was hard at first but I followed the prciples  this book  my baby slept 10-11 hours thru the night startg at week 5  Everyone tells me I have such a happy baby  I know that this book helped wh that
Tough love  the school of hard knocks f fants Unftunately I cannot say much good about this book So I will beg by mentiong what I found useful - 1 the auth albe rather fcefully remds us of the imptance of matag the maral relationship ( my opion this should not be done at the expense of the child(ren) The addion of a child to the family signies great le changes cludg posive relationship changes)  2 the auth stresses the imptance of learng to distguish your baby's cries  choosg a course of action based on this (sometimes however you just can't tell what the problem is   this case the baby most likely just needs to be held) That's  f the posive Although most would agree that fants  their families usually do better  they have some route  structure  their day the prescribed schedulg  this book is way way to stf Yes the auth repeatedly tells you to be \\"flexible\\" but flexibily is very dficult to achieve while matag the route He also repeatedly tells you not to deviate so much (from scheduled feed  nap times) that you fm a new \\"nm\\" Who needs to be this tied to a clock?There is an excellent chapter on sleep  how  wks  Richard Ferber's \\"Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems\\"
Nothg will sell books faster to sleep deprived parents faster than a book promisg to get their baby sleepg through the night  I purchased this book befe the birth of my son 2 years ago  After readg  I thought  would be very easy to get my son to sleep through the night usg their cry  out method  Nothg could be further from the truth  A week  two after I first brought my son home from the hospal I tried to let him cry  out to get him to go to sleep  this was gut wrenchg  I knew  my heart  was wrong to let my son's needs go unheeded so after tryg this once  twice I soon learned that  der f us all to get some sleep I had to igne that advice  nurse my son whenever he wanted  This is what nature tended not some ridiculous schedule  Also  you are breastfeedg nursg on dem is a sure fire way to establish your milk supply  Long sty sht my son is now a happy healthy well-adjusted 22 month old who knows that his needs are met  Do yourself a fav--  Dch this book  fav of Dr Sears' \\"The Baby Book\\"  You'll save yourself some sany!
I have nothg but praise f this book!!  What a breath of fresh air  the midst of confusg parentg advice out there  Up until two weeks ago my husb  I were tryg to follow the \\"child centered/ on dem\\" schedule that is so pushed by lactation nurses  others wh our first child  She was up all the time fussy  screamg I was nursg her what seemed like nonstop  my husb was sleepg on the couch My husb  I were at odds at what to do  completely sleep deprived  We felt like we were  bondage  Then a friend recommended this book  OH MY GOSH!!!  I didn't know parentg could actually be enjoyable!  I am an RN  even I didn't know what to do!!  This book's common sense approach  flexible schedulg are just awesome  Our daughter is so much happier  so are we  The crics that call  rigid must be out of their mds because  is no such thg  We are far from rigid  now we are a happy family of three Our 6 week old sleeps 5 hours at night takes regular naps throughout the day  is healthy  growg  She is alert  smilg  so content  As an RN I agree wh everythg  the book  It is healthy advice  everyway  Thank God f this book!!!
First Ezzo advocates common sense He does not suggest that you igne neglect  abuse your child He stead suggests a plan  a pattern to help you better underst the needs of your childDon't fall to the trap of igng this book by claims  of UNINFORMED people who thk that parents are abusg their children You will provide f your baby's needs befe they have to ask f  I can't thk of a better defion of a nurturg parent
I *loosely* followed \\"Babywise\\" at 6 months wh my older son  then at 4 months f my younger son I did so out of desperation: my older son wouldn't take me than a 10 mute nap durg the day He was breastfed on dem had no schedule whatsoever was carried around  a slg all day  never allowed to cry f me than a few seconds he wouldn't sleep when you tried to put him down! It just got wse  wse as he got older I tried f 17 days straight to just put him down  the crib f naps checkg on him every 5 mutes  sohe would scream himself to sleep after 2 hrs  then wake up 15 mutes later screamg Wh 2 days of puttg him on a very flexible feedg schedule per the Babywise book( not puttg him down right after a feed) he was takg sht naps whout fallg apart (which was enough f me at the time  I never followed the plan anyme than that)I still breastfed carried him  a slg  attended to his cries-I just stopped stuffg his face *every* time he cried  I gently but firmly put him down f naps The 2nd time around my baby started off takg naps but ended up like my 1st son by 4 months  I was exhausted! I 1st fed him every 2 hrs(I was feedg him sometimes me frequently than that!)  started puttg him down around the same times everyday f *scheduled* napssure he screamed but wh 2 days he started fallg asleep whout even a whimper! By 4 days I started feedg every 3 hrs durg the day  2 hrs  the eveng (he seemed hungrier) It has only been 1 week but he slept 7 hrs straight thru the night one time  he naps durg the day usually whout me than 5 mutes of cryg He has gone from beg fussy  irrable to much calmer  smilier!  F me followg the\\"feed/wake/sleep\\" pattern does provide a reference pot f my son's \\"typical\\" behavi AlsoI don't just \\"plop\\" him  the bed- I always pat him  kiss him  gently say \\"'s time to goto sleep\\" f about a mute (as a bridge f him to get ready to go to sleep) I thk the book allows f some flexibilyask yourself \\"is my baby *really* hungry  is he tired?\\"  I thk that is one of the keys to this book If your baby is older than one month  truly tired  you keep feedg him every 30 mutes  he keeps fussg screamg  fallg asleep at the breast maybe he's sleepy!!!I thk some babies really need a schedule   does help them get ganized  synchronizedAt least f me loosely followg the book has made a dference  has allowed me to get some me sleep  have a b of personal time (which makes me a happier me patient mommy!)
This book was recommended to me by 2 dferent friends  I read the book befe my TWINS arrived  fally pursuaded my husb to read  when they were about 2 weeks old  We started implementg Babywise when they were 3 weeks old  experienced an IMMEDIATE sleep improvement  It was absolutely AMAZING!  We were sold on the book's theies right then  there  This book REALLY wks  I recommend  to all my friends!
My husb  I read this book together- we couldn't put  down It helped us put  to wds our own beliefs  the practices we wanted to adopt as our own once we had our baby Our baby is now 5 months old She's been sleepg through the night sce she was 2 months old Everyone comments on what a well behaved baby she is At all of her pediatric check ups she is  the 95 percentile of kids her age f weight Some people say the methods recommended  this book are 'unhealthy'??? My daughter is proof that that is simply untrue Like some of the other reviews have said  you follow his advice as guideles  use your own common sense this method really wks I believe that because  this book our daughter is a much happier baby  we are much better parents also You have to be silly to let your baby run the schedule  the house They need lims  guideles from the get-gothis helps them learn trust- that you will take care of their needs
This is the best baby book that I have read  As a first time parent I had no idea what I was dog  this book brought me thru all of the tough steps - nappg feedg sleepg  At 8 1/2 weeks old our son started sleepg thru the night thanks to this book  the structure  brought to all of us!!!  I would have gone crazy whout this book!!!  It is a must f all new parents  f some parents down the road who are strugglg wh guides  rules  structure  schedules  I can not praise this book enought!!!
Here's the problem wh BabyWise: babies are dividual begs  They have dferent personalies  dferent needs  They are not ltle pieces of machery who need to be programmed to sleep f the convenience of their parents  And they are not ltle wks of \\"igal s\\" who need to be taught a lessonAnd you know what?  F every well-meang parent that Ezzo draws to this \\"program\\" there are a load me who are really glad that they now have \\"permission\\" to just \\"let 'em scream\\"  After all the pot is to have a \\"parent-centric\\" family where children \\"f \\"  aren't too much of a bother right?
I was given this book by someone who believed    have heard from several others that this is the way to go I even thought  was great myself I certaly want my baby to sleep through the night  her own bed  be on a perfect predictable schedule HOWEVER you must be flexible wh babies There is so much me gog on This book made me feel guilty f dog what I felt was right at the time (comftg my baby rockg her to sleep etc)  made me feel obligated to stay on a schedule regardless of the needs of my baby When you're breastfeedg sometimes you need to feed every hour  two durg growth spurts f example - otherwise your milk supply will not crease as needed  you  your baby will both be unhappy I couldn't fd where the book addressed that issue Still the idea of settg up a route is a good one  the child *shouldn't* be the center of your universe - these are ideals you should strive f But the auth is entirely too opionated ( adamant!) on the subject leadg new experienced parents to feel guilty f followg their stcts You know the transion from womb to wld is just a ltle to harsh to be imposg all these strict ideals so early on Be flexible  follow your stct Use this book as a guide but notas a bible!
I have tw girls  someone suggested readg this while still pregnantI did  thought there's some terestg ideas  Then I joed a group called mothers of multiplesthey suggested I read   said when you have tws whout a schedule you will go crazy  not have any st of a le  Use the book follow  always know there are exceptions to any rule use your gut stcts  you too will have well adjusted happy healthy babies!  My babies slept through the night at around 11 weeks they are extremely healthy very happy  a joy to be around  I followed the ma jist of the what the book was tellg me  made adjustments here  theredon't be so silly as to thk this is the bible  follow  to the letter - 's only a guidele  every baby is dferent  Open yourself to new possibilies  you'll be amazed at what you'll fd!
I have read several of his books cludg this one so that I could properly comment  The books are dangerous misguided misleadg  you would thk this man does not like children  His schedulg  sleepg recommendations have caused Failure to Thrive Syndrome  several fants some of them requirg hospalization please do a search on Ezzo  read what has been said his igal publisher dropped him because they ahve found that his claims can not be proven  directly oppose the American Academy od Pediatrics  the AMA  Please refer to DR Sears series of books stead
I am always amazed when I read the po reviews of this book This book was recommended to me when I was pregnant wh my first child Although I didn't agree wh everythg  had to say  made sense to me My child began sleepg through the night at 7 weeks He is now a happy 2 1/2 year old People are amazed at how happy  content he is And believe me he knows that he is loved by two parents who treasure him me than le self Baby number two is due  a month  my husb  I have every tent of havg another happy  healthy &quotBaby Wise&quot baby
Even though this method wont wk on every sgle child (as the auth would have you believe) we were able to tra both our girls to sleep the ne by 8 weeks of age
I was sent this book while pregnant wh my first son  I read   thought &quotthat sounds great !&quot  The book basically takes a your the boss  you shouldn't have to change your le to f your childs needs st  Once I got home wh my baby that all changed  Puttg him on a schedule was one thg but followg the advice of lettg him cry f hours on end until he figured  out was heart breakg  I thk that what everyone loses sight of is that each child is an dividual  What wks f one baby won't f another  The danger  this book falls  makg a new parent feel like a failure  there heart won't allow them to follow the advice of not pickg up your cryg child  Babies are thrown to this wld not by there choice but by yours which means  is your responsibly to give them love  care  Not only does this book talk about lettg your child scream f hours but about not pickg them up when they are awake(don't want to spoil them  make them feel wanted) not wearg them  any kd of carrier etc but you can play wh them durg &quotawake&quot times  No rockg your sweet baby to sleep while nursg  If I had followed this advice I would have missed out on SO many wonderful moments wh my son even  some of them were at three  the mng  I stead picked up a Drsears book after feelg like a failure f followg my heart  knowg I couldn't do that to my son  DrSears made me feel so much better  not only had medical experience he has 6 children of his own  Babywise makes you thk his way is the only way  In all realy  is not you caqn give your baby all the rockg holdg cuddlg  yes even sleepg wh you  the same bed!! And your child will sleep through the night on his own as did my son only after followg Dr Sears knider gentler methods  To me this book just gave the &quotok&quot to people who want to not listen to what there baby is askg f which may be me thanwhat they thought parenthood would be I thk that is were all the occurences of neglect  malnutrion come from people who say &quothey this guy says I can just throw the baby  the crib  come back every three hours  so&quot of course that is not what he says directly but that is what they hear as do IOne me thg  Tryg to get your baby on a schedule is of course the ultimate goal  parenthood f many  My issue was wh the many other statements made agast parents who do end up co-sleepg baby carryg rockg dem feedg  just pla lovg on there child  He states that these children aren't as dependent as are baby-wise babies  I am happy to rept that as completely untrue  My son was stg up at 4 months crawlg by 5  walkg by 9  He is the happiest toddler I know  My sister followed this book whout waiver  yes her children were sleepg through the night by 6 weeks but neher of them were even able to s up at ne months the oldest didn't walk until 15 months  the youngest not until 18  I have to thk this has somethg to do wh not be held of comfted  a part of the wld around them  But hey they defiantely aren't &quotspoiled&quot  Your child may sleep all night early by followg this book but thk about what the long term effects may be because I am sure that when a child has a problem at 4 years old wh behavi the parent will not remember how they treated their child as an fant  the effect  may have had
Use this book wh their on-le suppt They will email you back quickly  walk you through whatever problems you are encounterg We couldn't have survived colic whout this wisdom! Psalm 127:2God wants us to have sleep Babywise makes that possible
I don't que underst all of the negative reviews on this book  This book was recommended to me by numerous friends who have had success wh this program  Their children range from 6 months old to 5 years old  all are healthy  happy  We read this book  many others wh a crical eye  decided to use Ezzo's philosophy  Contrary to what many have wrten his ideas are not rigid  unlovg they are just the oppose  He teaches structure WITH flexibily  above all love your child!!This book has been a blessg to us  We don't use  as a law book just a reference  But I can tell you we have been VERY happy wh the results  so has our daughter
I am a new mom not just of one baby but of tws! And this book wked wonders f us Our babies were on a schedule the same schedule  sleepg through the night by 3 1/2 months Follow the advice  this book  you will be much less frustrated  much me well-rested  have a happy baby to boot! Dr Bucknam is my pediatrician  he is wonderful This book is just what the doct dered!!
This book brought common sense to our home after havg tws  1999 It gave us the confidence we needed as new parents As  a result of followg this book our children were happy content well adjusted fants People commented time  aga about how easy our children were just exactly the way the book said they would Our girls slept through the nights at 9  9 1/2 weeks  so did we We also found that this book put our kids on the same schedule that the materny ward used It also was completely acceptable to our pediatrician Our neighbs recommended this book to us  sce people actually ask us (just like the book said) how we did  we recommend  to every one
I am downright confused  baffled by all of the hysteria about this book  feel obliged to give the other side equal time!  Our fteen month-old tws have been happily  easily sleepg through the night sce they were ne weeks old thanks to Ezzo's suggestions  I believe this healthy route is fundamental to their emotional  neurological development (Don't we all thrive on schedules?)  Ezzo doesn't recommend strict adherence to schedules at all costs--just that the parent ease the fant toward a three-hour  whatever schedule then sleepg through the night when the child is physically able  ready to do so all the while payg attention to  meetg his needs  Ezzo gave me the confidence to create healthy structure f my tws (bn  September 2000)  we are all thrivg!  Bottom le:  this book is a tool  a confident mature parent possessg simple common sense can use s prciples to great advantage!
Strictly concontrolled schedules recommendation to use physical punishment f toddlers  no research to suppt their methods The auth has no professional background  child development  medice although he implies that he does The fant-feedg advice is consistent wh stard medical recommendations cludg that of the American Academy of Pediatrics  when followed f newbns can be downright le-threateng There are plenty of baby books out there this is not one I would recommend
If you love your child DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  This auth's publishg contract has been revoked after numerous repts of malnutrion  babies whose well-meang parents followed the methods advised  this book  Some babies under two have been seen DEPRESSED as a result of this book  The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly warns agast employg the practices outled  Babywise  Mr Ezzo holds no degrees  child development  pediatric medice  He advocates physical punishment leavg babies alone to cry  playpens  cribs f extended periods of time  strict feedg schedules  If you want a good book about baby care  parentg buy &quotThe Baby Book&quot by William Sears MD who by the way calls &quotBabywise&quot &quotthe most dangerous book I've seen  25 years of pediatric practice&quot
I am so sry but this is the sickest thg I have ever heard of My po 5 week old nephew is beg subjected to this deprivation of comft   is makg me sick God help you people
There are many unsubstantiated ( just pla wrong) medical facts  this book  Ezzo is notius f his negligent  abusive reccommendations  Babies have suufered malnurishment dehydration failure to thrive  even death because of parents followg his program  He has no credentials  is not an &quotexpert&quot of any kd  Do yourself a fav  save your money!

Truly this was a special gt when a friend had advised me to try this program This program also comes wh a video series I had  viewed the series wh 5 other couples whm have had  were expectg children Another friend who expectg her 6th child stated that her very 1st child was on a dem feedg  schedule  has sce done the baby wise technique on the other 5 children She stated that is why she decided to ave 5 me children Because of the baby wise phylosophy! I have done this baby wise technique wh my first child 5 years ago   wked  6  to 8 weeks followg her birth Wh my son who is 10 months old  took a ltle longer to get him to sleep through the night It took 11 to 12 weeks I nursed both children until they were 4  7 months of age They both also have very dferent personalies This techniqu is very flexible  wkable  any family suation provided that all parties cooperate wh what you are dog The cryg can get on your nerves but usually doesn't last very long  the gr scheme of le My babies are very well behaved most of the time  very friendly  enjoyable to be around As kids are they do have there moments but are very well rounded socially  mentally Excellent book  the most usefull tool sce the diaper!:)
This book was ( still is) a val tool  the parentg process f my first child  My husb had used  f his two children from a previous marriage  swe by the techniques discussed  this book  Schedulg my baby girl has been the best thg that I have ever decided to do f her  Despe some of the negative reviews I read pri to purchasg the book  was actually que simple I discovered nothg humane about   me than anythg my child is a very healthy  nurtured baby  By usg the suggested techniques  the book my baby was sleepg through the night by the time she was 3 months old  I cannot say enough good thgs about this bookI highly recommend 
Babywise is probably one of the wst books I have ever read  It fces babies to unhealthy schedules which are not suppted by current pediatric practices
Some of these people did not read the same book as I  I followed the same &quotsleepg  eatg route&quot outled  the book  My 4 week old went from eatg every 1 1/2 hours to every 3 hours which made my le wonderful  Befe readg this book all I did was feed  change  my child would only take 15-20 mute naps  At 8 weeks we was eatg every three hours  takg at least 2 naps that lasted 90 mutes  As f starvg him by followg Baby Wisepeople read way too much to   I never starved my child just taught him to be on a schedule  As f strikg a childI never read where you actually &quotstrike&quot a child  I read where you disciple them  I read to hold their hs down at the dner table  I have been told by many people that I don't even know that stop  talk to my baby that he is the happiest baby they have ever seen  He smiles at everyone  he is a baby wise babyMy daycare follows babywisechildwise  that is why I love   It is structured  All babies are on the same schedule  sleep at the same time  My baby went from a daycare where he slept wh the lights on while other babies cried to a daycare where they turn off the lights  have a fan that makes noise  They teach him to lay still on the changg table  keep his hs down when beg fed  This is disciplenot abuse
This book saved me &amp my family's lives!  It is easy readg f parents who are cravg sleep aga  some nmaly to their lives  The wrers give great examples to follow to help you  your baby get back on track while still beg plyable  It has been the most wonderful book I've read sce the birth of my baby  I always recommend  to new mothers
THe entire series of Babywise books is a must f all parents  There is nothg  the book but pla common sense  I can't underst why there is any controversy wh these books  I have 2 children  know countless others who give this method rave reviews  I am contually told how enjoyable my children are  raisg happy healthy  productive members of society is what 's all about
On becomg babywise has made me a confident new parent  Learg to observe my baby's needs versus a quick reaction has allowed me to read my child accurately  to respond accdgly  This book has taught me the imptance of hd milk  how to make sure your baby gets  structurg your baby's route  learng to trust your stcts  I started schedulg my son right away  The first month he gaed just under 15 ounces a day  was a delight to be around  I breastfeed exclusively  has been sleepg through the night (11:00pm to 6:00am) from seven weeks  He's now 5 months  goes down at 7:00pm  wakes up cheery at 7:00am He is 98%  height  87%  weight  I am lookg fward to readg On Becomg BabyWise II
This book is great f new parents because  gives a framewk about feedg  sleepg Many people confuse s route wh &quotschedule&quot  are put off However I found that I was able to combe the &quotattachment parentg&quot  Dr Sears book (the Baby Book) wh the babywise route very well even though most people told me that the two theies were diabolically opposed I recommend readg them both  usg what wks best f you  your baby
This book came recommended to be by a trusted friend  mother of 3  This book changed my le  I went from an overwhelmed sleep deprived mother to one that was confident   charge  My emotional connection wh my fant became stronger as I started to underst what she needed  I thought his philospies of creatg a stable dependable daily route centered around eatg playg  nappg were easy to follow I thk that parents underestimate the abilies of their children  This book not only helped me to create stable sleep patterns (day  night)but also helped me raise a toddler who has self-control  confidence she can rise to the challenges of her growth  development at her pace wh our encouragments  love
Sleep deprovation can drive any sane person to the brk however  is a fact of le  you have decided to become a parent  Whether you are up feedg comftg  just wryg-children's needs are not always &quotconvenient&quotStikg a balance whout rigidy is key That's why this book is not a total loser  But read   adapt the parts that you need  Remember you your child  family are unique  abolutely no one knows your children better than you
In my opion when readg this book you have to take the good  leave the bad  I do get tired of readg nasty reviews of this book by extremists who believe that you should follow attachment parentg  If you DO believe  attachment parentg then don't waste your time wh this book!  This book will give you a lot of good fmation  is based on the Biblical stance that the most imptant relationship  the house is the one between mom  dad  If you don't agree wh this posistion don't get the book  I do thk that the book can be a ltle extreme  some of s ideas  A book that will help you see a me BALANCED :) approach to parentg is Secrets of the Baby Whisperer  which you will learn how to terpret your baby's cries so you can still meet his  her needs I highly recommend that anyone who doesn't agree wh attachment parentg read both Babywise  Secrets of the Baby Whisperer then take what wks f you  leave what doesn't!
I read this book befe the birth of my first child  I followed the prciples  my baby fmed his own schedule  He almost never cried unless  was time f him to eat  he was ready to go to sleep  And then only  I was not payg attention to the schedule  My child started sleepg through the night (9 hours) at 6 1/2 weeks  I had my second child 6 months ago  at 7 weeks he started sleepg 12 hours a night  And he still does!  I am a much nicer  happier mother when I have had a full night's rest  They are happy too!  There has been some bad press about the auths but I thk that comes about when certa readers are milant about stickg to every ltle detail no matter what  This book does not tell you to fce your child to confm to whatever you decide is best  You just should use common sense  make sure that the babies are havg an adequate number of wet  poopy diapers  gag the right amount of weight  You will be able to tell  you just pay attention  If they are thrivg they will be happy!  PS  Wh my first child I nursed  wh my second I bottle fed  This method wked wonderfully wh both suations  Good luck!
Ezzo should have checked his assertions wh lactation consultants His advice to schedule breastfeedg is a practice that is known to contuously reduce a mother's milk supply  ()Ezzo's advice makes  dficult  impossible f mothers to follow the recommendations of the US Surgeon General the American Academy of Pediatrics  the Wld Health Organization all of which advocate extended breastfeedgNew parents beware of irresponsible auths such as Ezzo
I loved this book!  I started usg  on my child right after birth  I now have a happy  healthy baby  My baby has always been at the 95th percentiles f both weight  height  I attribute my baby's healthy growth to Baby Wise  It makes me sad that so many people have been opposg this method whout readg the book  really tryg   If you do read   try  you will love   It's not mean to put your baby on a schedule 's mean NOT to  It will help them regulate themselves f their entire lives  I highly recommend this book   I didn't love my child I wouldn't use the method  It's a great book-- give  a try
This book has been a total le saver  My baby was a preemie  a lot of advice  the book is exactly what the hospals do- like puttg your baby on a schedule  If your child's environment is stable  has a route then  becomes obvious when somethg is amissThis is my fave baby shower gt--along wh Dr Spock's book
This book really saved us as new parents who had no idea what to do all day wh this beautul bundle of joy that God had blessed us wh Although we don't follow the book wd f wd  has given us a wonderful basis on which to build We don't have our baby on a rigid schedule but we have given him a route He knows what to expect next  has really taken to that route Our 11 week old son now sleeps from about 9pm to about 6am (this varies of course but he has a nice long stretch which gets us all a good night's sleep) Mom also knows when she'll have time to take a shower  get some wk done around the house Everyone has a happier disposion cludg baby sce we've started usg some of the Baby Wise methodsI would  do recommend this book to all my expectg friends I can't say 's given us our pre-baby lives back but  has given us a great new structure f family le
When I first bought this book I was desperate f help wh gettg my daughter to sleep  But after readg   then readg up on Ezzo  I threw away the book   Sure wh his way you might be able to get your child to sleepbut that child would never know the comft of your lovg arms  You signed on to be a parent so stick  out  do what's right f your child  Don't try  f your child to your leyou'll end up scarrg him/her  ways you can't image  (There have been cases of babies dyg wh Ezzo's methods by the way)  Do some readg ABOUT Ezzo befe  you actually read his book
I found this book to be valuable durg the first ne weeks of my baby's le We started the three-hour schedulg after the first week   wked      I have met ten  twelve new parents who have used this book  all have endsed  wh their own successes  I have never met anyone who has read the entire book adopted the underlyg parent-directed feedg philosophies  has said that  failed them
I am not gog to jump to the debate about whether the methods prescribed by the auths are good  whether the auths pray to Satan (as some reviewers would have you believe)Fally as wh all methods  should be practiced wh fliexibly  common sense  Only you know your baby
I have listened to all the tapes  read all the books  the Growg Kids God's way series  At first I was thrilled to learn parentg techniques that would give me the abily  confidence to raise a Godly child but the me I read the me doubts I began to havePlease keep  md that God created you to be your child's parent  God gives you the power of choice to choose what will be best f your child  He trusts that you will trust Him to lead you  Also remember that there are many Godly people out there wh good parentg advice  Read a lot pray a lot love your child deeply  the answers will come  God bless
My baby wanted to breastfeed every five mutes  All the advice I got was to feed him on dem  This was wrong f me  f him He was cryg all day  never satisfied I couldn't even take a shower  Wh three days of followg the Babywise guideles everyone was happier parents  baby  The approach to disciple wked as well (although we have never subscribed to h slappg)  The idea of allowg your child only the freedoms that he can hle is excellent  let us disciple wh fesight to the future We have a 2 1/2 year old who can s through dner at a nice restaurant  has slept through the night f two years  We do not have the problems our peers have wh gettg their toddlers to take naps  beg  public  All the playgroup parents comment on how well behaved  happy our child is  He is a joy to be around  I believe a lot of  is due to Babywise  As wh anythg you need to do what you feel good about we did not follow this to the letter  Havg our baby get used to the schedule was not easy  But once we saw the results we contued  he did cry considerably less than befe usg Babywise

This book was recommended to us by other parents who swe by  wh their kids  I adm  was dficult to get used to  the begng but  gets easier after the first few weeks  We started when our son was about 4 weeks old  He's now 8 weeks  sleeps 7 hours straight!  He's a very happy baby  not deprived of any love  comft  It really helps you to get  to a &quotflexible&quot route  It's a great book!
When my son was bn they told me  the hospal to feed him whenever he cried &quot my milk wouldn't come &quot  After a few days of feedg him every five mutes much of the day  night I was exhausted discouraged se  seriously questiong my abily to be a parent  I knew that this method of feedg would not wk f meI realize that not every baby will embrace a schedule as well as my son but I encourage every new parent to try to put their child on a schedule  It won't hurt them  won't cost you a penny   may save your sany!
My we liked  so much that we are now buyg  We had previously checked  out of the library Much of the book is fluff but there's also some valuable fo
My friend received this book after 6 months wh her new baby boy  She had decided that  this was motherhood she wouldn't have another child  He was wakg up 3-4 times every night  she was exhausted physically  mentally  After she read the book she used the prciples  wh a week he was sleepg through the night  I've used the route wh all 3 of my kids  By the 3rd who is now 9 months old  had become second nature f me  All 3 slept through the night  2-3 months  There are always exceptions to the rule however  Some parents  some babies may not do well wh this  But I wouldn't blame the method  You respond to your baby's needs accdg to the framewk of the method  It makes  easier to determe what they need  I was able to sleep at night recover from the birth function durg the day  love  enjoy my babies  I recommend  to anyone  If you feel me comftable shteng the time between feedgs do   It will take longer to sleep through the night but that's okay too  Use  but  a semi-relaxed way  My only suggestion would be to have a woman's touch  the wrg

What an awful concept of child-rearg What are this auths credtials anyway?  Yes children may grow  sleep like clockwk on this \\"program\\"  their parents may blissfully sleep thru the night sce their babies know that their cries are not wth respondg to But what about babies emotional needs? They are human you know- the most fragile vulnerable of all humans   desperate need of the physical conact  responsiveness of other humans-namely their parents If you want somethg to \\"tra\\"  to f very conveniently to your lestyle get a dog No that might require too much efft- get a lizard And people wonder why so many people  this country are emotional wrecks  lonely-- the foundations are laid  fancy wh books like these Don't buy -be a real parent  follow your stcts []
I have seen this book wk f many people But f  to wk the parents have to be commed to the child to each other  to God! There is no way around  I have seen  wk wh nieces  nephews  my family I can't compare the posive comments that the parents receive from those observg the child as  matures  this happy environment I can very well pick a child out of a group of children that have been raised by this book compared to those that have not The dference is eye openg Those parents that do not care f this book have the right to their own opions But those that don't believe  God  his prciples will never underst the purpose behd this book If you had the older version of the book  is all biblically based  you can't underst one whout understg the base f the book The Bible!I am pregnant now I plan to use this book f my own children after seeg all the posive results  the families that I am close to I look fward to havg this wk f my children as well
Befe I had my 2 1/2 year old daughter I read the Baby Wise book f myself to see what everyone was so wked up about Some people loved   some were so strongly agast  After readg  I tried  I was very impressed wh the schedulg system f feedgs  naps I tried  wh my daughter from day 1  I will never regret  no matter who hates this book My daughter is  always has been very healthy   the 75% percentile  height size  weight She was sleepg through the night at 8 weeks of age This book helped our family enjoy one another through stabilization  route I just had my baby boy  I used the same program f him He is as &quotchubby&quot as they come  is sleepg through the night at 7 weeks old Because of his schedule that I adopted from the book he  my daughter are happy  healthy They know they are loved  have never felt secure due to lack of route I strongly would recommend this book but you must read  f yourself Don't read some of these previous negative reviews  say &quotfget &quot Read  f yourself  then decide  you thk this program will wk f your family ***One me thg: I was so nervous as a first time mom  had the &quotbaby blues&quot pretty bad This book helped brg structure to my le  my precious baby's le I loved the outcome so much that I used the same program f my son  because I knew what I was dog now this time around  was so much easier
We were the last of our friends to have children We watched our friends parent their children accdg to various philosphies Those who used the book On Becomg Baby Wise had children sleepg through the night as early as 12 weeks babies who didn't cry when put down f a nap didn't need to be read to  truly loved their cribs We had tw boys  knew that we were gog to follow the philospohy of this book It wked great We have healthy happy well adjusted babies Parents should realize that every time a baby cries he  she does not need to be fed This is just common sense A lot of what the book expouses is just common sense I couldn't have made  through the first months of my children's lives whout 
I have used many of the thgs suggested  this book  my children are happy  healthy As wh any parentg book take the techiques  use them wh common sense I have 3 content healthy  still fully spired children ages 1 to 5 who have blossomed while usg much of the advice  these books But keep  md that this isn't the only way to have happy  healthy children just one way Parentg is a very sensive topic to most parents  everyone seems to thk their way is the best There is a lot of strong emotions out there from the attachment parentg group as some of the reviews on here show Igne the fightg over which parentg method is best -  search your heart f whichever one wks best f you I loved the Ezzo's books  my children are flourishg - but every child ( parent f that matter) is dferent so know that there are many great ideas out there  that this is just one of them
I had a baby a year ago Like every other mother-to-be I was receivg helpful  not so helpful hts from everyone on parentg But one thg everyone seemed to agree upon was that when the baby came there would be no me sleep f me f a while In the begng that was very true Ftunately I had been told by a few friends about the book On Becomg Baby Wise Each of the women that told me about this books suggested that I buy the book  read  befe I even came home wh the baby They were so right Wh the help of this book my son was sleepg through the night  about 8  9 weeks That made him happier   made my husb  me happier because we were much less sleep deprived I know people wh babies that are a year old  are still not sleepg through the night That is because they never tried the methods used  On Becomg Baby Wise At a year old my baby is thrivg Many of the people I knew said that the methods  this book wouldn't wk I am here to tell you that they do wk Every parent to be should have this wh them on the way to the lab room
We have friends who used this technique wh excellent results - their kids are happy have good manners  pleasant sweet kids We bought the books thkg they would lead us to parenthood We were  f a rude awakeng Our son cried seemgly all the time  was very fussy I felt like a failure b/c I couldn't schedule him Then I started dog thgs to survive - puttg him  bed wh me Nursg on dem wh the goal of tryg to schedule him(the book seems to promote fmula over nursg) When I lightened up  let my son lead me to parenthood - baby  parents did much better He is now on a sleepg schedule  an eatg schedule but not b/c of the book The books don't talk enough about lovg them  listeng to them I am an derly person  my son is dog well but not b/c of the books I would not recommend them to other parents If you feel miserable b/c you fall sht of this auth's lofty expectations don't despair You are  good company!
[Gary Ezzo] discourages breastfeedg  holdg your child closely  tries to convce the reader that any parent who devotes time  attention to their child's needs is weak
We allowed our first child to dictate her schedule the first six months of her le (after all fants know what they need right???  WRONG!) The result was lots of late nights tryg anythg to just get a few hours of precious sleep!  As a result both mom dad  child were tired  cranky durg the dayMy suggestion read the book  then make a decision
What can I say  I have bought  followed the babywise books sce I was pregnant  My son is now 13 months old  Durg our last vis to the Pediatrician the doct commented on how smart  confident our boy was  She said our baby already had a strong sense of himself  a lot of self-esteem  The doct is aware that we have followed the Babywise concepts  she added  all her years as a pediatrician she has seen this over  over aga wh Babywise children  I've also observed that all the mothers  my mom's group that have utilized Babywise have had the same resultsgood sleepg habs good eatg habs  good disposions  The other moms' children the result has not been as consistent  Many a new mom has asked me about babywise concepts  All of them have had success when they are consistant  stick to the Babywise ideals  As to the sleepgI've learned 's very simple  Babywise teaches the baby to fall asleep on their own  Not like Dr Ferber that suggests you let the child cry themselves to sleep n usg the bottle  nursg as a crutch to gettg your child to go to sleep  It's all very healthy  natural  makes f a happy baby a happy dad  a happy mom
Dear Readers I was 4 weeks to the le of my 1st child when my brother mentioned the book  It is a lesaver   does wk  My brother now takes cred f his niece sleepg through the night  The moms  dads implementg the schedule need a ltle back-bone but  will make your baby  family happy  Give  a shot - well wth every penny! - a content  well rested mother from NYC
I have used this book twice now The first time wh my daughter when she was 5 weeks old She was sleeepg 8 hours a night by 8 weeks old I breastfed successfully f 10 months wh her (she self-weaned because I was pregnant wh my second) She is now 2 years old  I often get compliments on her sweet easy gog nature  how well she rests f naps  bedtime I haven't had a fuss from her f eher  over a year She actually LIKES bedtime :)If you're still not sure what to do -- take a look at some of the families you know  fd out how they parented The familes wh why dficult children  cranky parents likely didn't use this book  the ones wh calm discipled children  happy babies likely did
This past weekend I went diggg f my Baby Wise book  This book was recommended to me when I was pregnant wh my first child  My husb  I both read   our now 26 month old son has been sleepg through the night sce he was 7 weeks old  He is such a happy  lovg baby  He has never fought bed-time  now that he is a ltle older I thk he enjoys his alone time  his bed  As I prepare f baby #2 which is due  February I plan to reread this book  And as I did the first time I will cpate Mr Ezzo's wds wh my own common sense  do what I feel is best at any given time  I have complete confidence that our next child will be able to sleep through the night at an early age  that he/she will be just as happy healthy  lovg because of the parent-centered family that he/she has been bn toThis book is wonderful  Every new parent wh common sense should have a copy
I first reviewed this book when my baby was 3 months old  had started sleepg through the night at 9 weeks usg the prescribed methods  Now at 7  1/2 months I'm still a believer  I have a happy thrivg baby who often heaves a sigh of relief when we put him down  his crib to sleep (&quotFally!&quot I image him thkg)I'm not sure why people get so emotional about this book  As far as I can tell from reviews the people who have tried the method like   the people who gave negative reviews never actually tried   I must adm I was sceptical when I started  but  was truly like magic!
My mother her best friend  my sister have all used Baby Wise  counldn't be me happy wh s results  So as a first time mother I am now tryg  as well  I am not gog to lie  is hard at first to put your newbn on a schedule but  is a lot easier than what I went through  the first week  a half of dem feedg  I was dem feedg my baby every hour  a sleepless mom is a cranky mom  I started my daughter on this schedule when she turned 2 weeks old  already she knows the dference between night  day  we have to wake her f her feedgs  My milk supply has run sht but I have just been pumpg extra  that helps out a lot also that helps my husb bond wh the baby he gets up at 3am to feed her while mommy can sleep a ltle extra  It is hard wk no matter what to be a parent but I believe this book makes a lot of sence  no where  the book does  say to starve your baby  you feel your baby is truly hungry feed her even   isn't her feedg time yet
I've read some of the reveiws f this book  found  very suprisg to hear some of the negative feedback  You may not agree wh all that the book has to say but the schedule wks!  It is not abusive  dangerous!  My son is beg brought up  a very lovg  carg Christian home  because of what this book teaches he was able to regulate his nights  days exceptionally early  Not only was this a blessg to his parents but  made his transion from womb-to-wld a me enjoyable  less frustrag one  I have at least four friends that I can name off the top of my head that have also read  used this book  are overwhelmg thankful f 's sights  All of their children slept through the night at an early age as well  None of our children have been mistreated under-nourished neglected  abused as some of the reveiws try to lead people to beleive It has been crediably helpful to my family  I would recommend  to all my closest frds  loved ones
This book is great  My daughter started sleepg through the night at 4 weeks  is a breeze to put down f naps  bedtime  In addion she wakes up wh a big smile  is happy throughout the day  There are a lot of negative reviews out there  while I underst the concern unless you've tried  you can't know  This book stresses over  over aga that the suggestions are guideles f parents - not hard  fast rules  This book shows parents how to parent telligently wh full faculties not just emotion  It very much says that parents should respond to cryg but wh the right kd of response  Cryg is the only fm of communication babies have   is up to the parents to terpret what they are  If a child spoke:  \\"I'm hungry I'm tired I'm wet I\\"m scared I'm bed\\" you wouldn't automatically feed them!  You would do the appropriate response which may be feedg
readers should know that not only is this book a disastrous discussion on child rearg  is also a very controversial bookdon't bother readg this book you don't have to reach the page where the auths tell you that -- your 2 year old wets  soils his underpants  the flo that he should be spanked  then told to clean up his mess  himself after-- to know that the auths are severe  even somewhat bizarre there are better well-wrten thoughtful  humane books by educated  qualied auths to choose from
The beauty of PDF is that  teaches parents to THINK befe they ACTAny ption of PDF that a parent doesn't agree wh they are free not to do   Take what you like  toss the remaderSome mothers reject the idea of routes wh their children  Routes  my household provide stabily  an established framewk by which my son  family can totally rely  Durg the day  at night there is no guessg what happens next  My son is happy  secure  PDF helped make that possible
This book has good plans of helpg your baby sleep though the night however the first problem is the &quotBabblg&quot It seems as though the auth jumps from one thg to another makg his pots confusg  F those of you Pre-readg befe your ltle one comes dont bother Your child is dferent  may require dferent choices  Whats me imptant givg your child what IT needs  choosg to do  the books way
I strongly recommend On Becomg Babywise!  It is a wonderful resource that has made a huge dference  our family  Every day we thank God f the Ezzos  their book!  Everythg  the book came true  F example: our daughter learned to sleep through the night at 8 weeks we did not have to baby proof our house  everywhere we went people said &quotwhat a happy baby&quot  Whenever we had a concern we opened the book  found the solution listed right there  It gave us confidence  our parentg because we had a resource to which to turn  Our daughter has just turned 2  now naps two hours  the afternoon  sleeps 11 hours at night  Because she is so well rested she is alert  happy durg the day  We know 3 other couples that had babies at the same time we did  All of us followed the Babywise prciples  we all had great results  Each of our children is unique wh a dferent temperament  dferent skills -  they all are flourishg  We all also implemented the prciples  Babywise II  the class called &quotGrowg Kids God's Way&quot  I have studied most of the cricism of Babywise  of the Ezzos  Sometimes I wonder  the crics have even read the book!  I fd the most common crisism to be that people didn't want their babies to cry when hungry  Neher does Babywise!  Babywise says over  over to feed your baby  s hungry  So don't let that wry stop you from readg the book Other crics say  is the easy way out  solely f the convenience of the parent  Parentg is an credibly imptant responsibily  I don't thk  is ever easy  However usg this book you at least have a basic parentg philosophy  a basele agast which you can compare other advice  I recommend  wholeheartedly!
As far as Babywise goes I operate  two dferent spheres I have friends who have read  basically implemented Babywise prciples  those who haven't The dferences are remarkable In one group of friends everyone tells hr sties about beg up all night wives feedg through the night at eighteen months etc In my other group of Babywise friends we stopped talkg about sleepg through the night long long ago Nobody's child wakes up  the night me than once  a couple of months  certaly no one's child eats  the middle of the night Cocidence? I fd  hard to believeWe used Babywise  found  by  large to be very sightful so I'll just add one me testimonial to this list After I fish this post I'll go   check on my ltle boy who is sleepg  will most likely contue to sleep through the night as he has f the past hundreds of nights  a row Judge f yourself

This book is truly apallg  The so-called Christian methods of the Ezzos have been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics (a very conservative ganization) because so many fants whose parents have followed the advice  this book have had to be treated f failure to thrive (read:  starvg)  The Ezzos have no trag at all  nutrion   the mechanics of breastfeedg yet sist  promotg a rigid feedg schedule which causes breastfed babies to starve promotg the idea that most modern mothers sadly &quotcan't&quot breastfeed  I am not even gog to go to their ridiculous ideas about how fants are spoiled  you hold them  attend to them  about how they advocate strikg babies  Please avoid this book  you care about your child's health  God does not condone child abuse
I had to crge at some of the reviews that people have wrten on this book! I fd  terestg that one must defend themselves f wantg to sleep at night once they have a baby! As a Mother of 8 month old tws who was given the book as a gt  read  when they were almost 2 months old have become a believer that my children are happier  me secure than others I am around that have not used Ezzo's method! I fd that everyone asks what I have done to make the babies so good  content! I thk  was hard wk to follow this schedule at first  that must be why some people fd  an unacceptable method! I must say when the babies were still very young I wished that some parts of the book would have been me explany  but I now realize that is the beauty of Ezzo's methodIt can f to your lestyle as you choose You can be as strict  as flexible as need be My children have NEVER cried me than 8 mutes to get to sleep  that isn't very often! And even at 8 months they are the longest 8 mutes of my le but the babies wake happy  ready to play! They were preemies  have thrived on this feedg schedule!  So I am confused as to why anyone would say  is unhealthy f a baby except that maybe the parent rushed their child onto the next step befe he was ready!  It took much longer f my preemie tws to sleep through the night but that was ok wh me as I wanted them to grow  thrive!! I recommend this method  you want content  secure children! This method teaches you the parent how to teach your baby to go to sleep whout hours of walkg the halls! It doesn't ever say just let the baby cry all night eher! It gives you the time to play  love your baby durg the day because the baby is on a schedule that you have designed to help him sleep through the night!  We are now readg Babywise II  just as happy wh the method!
Here's what just one auth had to say about this book &quotYet many breast-feedg mothers have repted a failure to produce an adequate milk supply when followg the program Some pediatricians see adequate weight ga dehydration  failure to thrive among newbns on the program&quot  This book is so dangerous that Ezzo's ed Jeff Gerke was fired when he spoke out about the dangers of this book The publishg house self Multnomah has waffled  their opion about Ezzo Further the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement  April of 1998 about the dangers of this program  LLL has also spoken out agast Ezzo's tles  Many many of the customer reviews state that you need &quotcommon sense&quot to use this program however that contradicts the spir of this book  Ezzo does NOT advocate pickg  choosg from this method  In fact he admonishes parents not to waiver from the program  any way  To me that's a BIG red flag Folks this guy is gog to get sued 's only a matter of time Check out Dr Sears Nighttime Parentg f a me balanced  validated approach
I laughed when I read the July 4 review from Aust Texas  It was rather overdramatized  This book was recommended to me while I was pregnant wh my first child  I went to the bookste  scanned the book I thought &quotNot very terestg chance is what makes a baby sleep through the night&quot  I didn't buy the book  I started gettg nervous as the due-date got closer  I kept hearg the endless sties of children of all ages not sleepg well  I decided to buy the book  I've recommended this book to several people cludg a stay-at-home dad wh tws  Everyone  has come back  thanked me f the recommendation  It would have been dficult whout !
As a sleep-deprived mom of five under age 8 I foolishly followed the advice  this book As a result I was unable to produce enough milk - f the first time after nursg the first four children an average of 10 months each If you really want to breastfeed please don't follow the Ezzo's advice
The concept that babies can somehow be programmed to do what parents want at such young ages seems to me a professional nanny f the past 8 years absurd  bderle abusive The rigidy of schedulg suggested  Ezzo's book does not wk well f every baby Babbies are dferent  experienced  secure parents could easily endanger an fant  they become determed to stick to the harsh schedulg suggested by Ezzo Any attempt to &quottra&quot a baby are sure to backfire sce babies are not pets to be traed - a baby will keep cryg f attention  that attention is denied them whereas a pet will go away eventually  ignedDo yourself  your baby a fav - trust your stcts ask f help from family docts  friends  DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
The moment my husb  I found out we were gog to have a baby we immediately started to prepare ourselves We signed up f educational classes at the hospal read books spoke to relatives etc We thought we were totally prepared  Thgs changed the moment we brought our daughter home It took 2 days f her to completely get her nights  days mixed up! This contued f a month  our effts to crect the problem failed My mother--law purchased the book f us after a co-wker told her about  I thank her every day!  My daughter is 5 months old  she is such a pleasure to be around Everytime we take her out people always comment on what a happy child she is She slept through the night at 2 month's  we haven't had any problems sce If you fd yourself rockg your child endlessly to get them to fall asleep then tiptoeg them to their crib prayg you don't wake them get this book It is truly a miracle!
Anyone who claims that abusg a child by igng their NEEDS is NOT followg God's plan they are ridg sfully on God's coattails!  If you had a child to complete your collection of material goods this book will come  hy as you tra your child like a trophy dog  Otherwise I strongly suggest a good book burng  A terric example of why children today are shootg each other  school
I absolutely recommend this book to every couple expectg a baby  I buy this book f every baby shower I go to   I did not have this book on my first child  she did not sleep thru the night till at least a good 6 months  We used  on our second child  she was sleepg thru the night at 6 weeks!  This gave me much me energy to be a better mom stead of beg so tired because I was up so many times durg the night feedg  One thg on this bookmy husb  I took from  what we thought applied to us  our child  I know of some people that followed this book like a bible  absolutely went overboard  We liked the concepts  tried them  they wked f us but we were not extreem wh some thgs  This is defetly a good book to keep on h
This book has s mers  My husb  I used the methods as guideles  Every baby is dferent so I don't thk there is one &quotmagical&quot method that would apply to all  Some appear to have better luck wh this method than others  We felt  had some useful fmation helpg us to get our baby on a schedule which was imptant  We found  very dficult to let our child cry over 10 - 15 mutes so we don't do that but we do try to follow the eat play sleep schedule where we can
Get the book  use what makes sense to you The book  my opion is meant as a guidele I just put my 2 months old baby on the 3-hour schedule as the book suggested The result? A happier baby  a happier mom too The schedule makes sense f the baby because he needs a b of structure Befe he used to feed - snack would be me accurate - every hour  a half Now he eats better sleeps better  smiles me! I now realize that babies actually NEED to cry sometimes Even  's still hard f me to let him cry  out (15-20 mutes is my personnal lim) after he goes to sleep he wakes up rested   a better mood My boy sleeps about 5  a half hours at night which is a great improvement from his fmer 2 hours
I bought this book from Amazoncom when I was about 7 months pregnant  A friend had recommended  sayg that  &quotsaved her le&quot  I suppose meang that her baby was able to sleep through the night  Beg a new parent  I of course was terested  I began usg Ezzo's strategies when my baby was 10 days old  I thought that I should be  control after all I was the parent right??  At six weeks I decided to allow my baby to &quotcry  out&quot   der to get him to sleep through the night   I was so tired of always gettg up wh him  I lay  bed rent wh guilt f up to 45 mutes  I could tell he was hungry but the book had said that he would go back to sleep  Then I would fally feed him  I was breastfeedg too so my milk was soakg through my night clothes while he cried  Well this went on f three nights  I fally decided that this &quotmethod&quot was not right f me  Soon after I began attendg La Leche League meetgs  met the most wonderful babies  mothers who gave me an entire new outlook on parentg  Now stead of dreadg the time that I have to get up wh my baby ( 5 mo old) I look fward to the special time we can share togetherI hope this review helps people to see the err  followg Ezzo's ideas
There is nothg &quotChristian&quot about this type of child rearg except that throughout histy dividuals have used their religious beliefs to justy abusg their children  (an excellent book entled SPARE THE CHILD by Phillip Greven documents the theological igs of abusive child rearg practices  early American Christiany but this behavi is by no means limed to Christians)I say this as a devout Christian who  her baptismal vows agreed to &quotrespect the digny of every human beg&quot  I won't get to the medical issues although the tenets of this book go agast everythg I know as a breastfeedg mother  Remember--fanticide was practiced as a fm of birth control  Jesus' day but Jesus said that we must become as ltle children to enter the Kgdom of Heaven
This strategy put fth  this book isn't easy but  is smart   wks  There is nothg me controversial than opions on how to raise a baby so 's not suprisg that some parents reject Baby Wise  We recommend this method to all our friends but some have chosen not to follow   Frankly we enjoy havg a baby who sleeps through the night  is on a predictable schedule  We have to make some sacrafices (we don't just go to ballgames  hook the baby up to the boob f the duration like some parents do) but 's wth   This system has made our le much easier  made us better rested parents
Babywise is the secular book based on the same prciples of Ezzo Growg Family International &quotchristian&quot parentg mistry In these books Ezzo makes statements such as: &quotA child is not bn mally good but wh a natural predisposion f mal waywardness&quot (Growg Kid's God's Way p18)Cryg is not a baby misbehavi! It is their only way to communicate! New parents be wary1
This book was truely a helpg h wh our first child  Concerned about wantg to do all the right thgs  at the right time  development BabyWise provided us a useful tool of knowledge  When our baby startg sleepg thru the night at 3 weeks we felt like we had a program that was right f us  The books disucssion of how to get your baby on a feedg  sleepg route  the example suggestions on keepg your baby a wake after feedgs stead of puttg them down f a nap only make sense when you consider the energy you have after eatg somethg yourself (Provided that  is healthy  not full of sugar) Havg route  a fants le is fundamental but the rewards outweight the hard wk  Our daughter is now three  we have contued to use the BabyWise philosohpy  she is still a good sleeper   Also the overall fmation  the book on when is best to start feedg solids what kd to try first  helpful suggestions on potty trag have answered a lot of our questions  reduced our fear of dog what is right  when The over all philosphy of mal vs maly is started  the early stages of le  we all hope as parents  is carried wh our children as they grow  mature  Babywise  the series of books followg can assist  reducg the fear fact  parents
This book was credibly helpful to me wh my firstbn who has been sleepg through the night sce 7 weeks old  I started usg the prciples  the book when she was 4 weeks old  would have started sooner  I had known about this bookIt's a fast read  gives you good strategies to wk wh  The tone is a ltle sensationalistic &quotyou too can have what has wked f over 500000 babies&quot  Every kid is dferent  you will want to take ideas from this book  adapt  to your own personal suation  I didn't follow what they say to do exactly but I used the spir behd the auth's priciples looked at my own baby's style  experienced success  I hope you do too
I am a soon to be first time mom  this book was given to me by a friend  I have also been a first grade school teacher f 10 years  I see everyday the effects of unstructured home le on children  I have put a lot of thought to how I want to raise my child  when I read this book  made so much sense to me  Some of the previous reviews seemed to be sayg that the book suggests neglectg your child  This is not the case at all  It suppts dog whatever is best f your child at any given moment   many dferent suations so that your child can grow to be confident  content  I completely agree wh teachg your child to be a part of a family team  givg them a purpose  le rather than teachg them that they are the center of the universe  I know two mothers who use the methods from this book wh their babies  both babies are very happy  well mannered  If these methods were  any way neglectful  abusive I don't thk this would be the case  Children need structure  their lives!  After readg this book I feel much me confident that I will be a good parent
My experience  applyg the prciples of this book to a colicy baby were entirely dferent than the other reviewer's  Le wh my baby was a nightmare until I read this book  As a first-time mom  gave me a blueprt f how to deal wh a le of chaos  My baby's colic didn't go away only time can accomplish that however Ezzo's schedule was actually soothg to my baby  seemed to mimize the pa she experienced  Although her colic contued to 4 mos she started sleepg through the night most nights at about 3 mos  her total sleep-time durg a 24 hour period doubled after readg this book  (she slept only 10 hours total  a 24- hour period befe readg this book) Also I would add that  my circle of friends &quotBaby-Wise&quot mothers seem to lose their &quotI-haven't-slept--20-years&quot look months befe the mothers who don't agree wh the book  would rather let baby run the show  Their children also seem to be happier  me well-adjusted overall  Take  wh a gra of salt  of course use common sense  My husb  I highly recommend  to anyone who wants to have children  still have a le!
We have a set of tws  used this method of teachg our girls to sleep through the night  This saved our lives  The girls are now 21m old  have been sleepg through the night sce they were 10weeks old  We put them  the crib they do not fuss  they play f a few mutes  then just drt off to sleep  As a stay-at-home-dad wh tws I know what I'm talkg about as far as this saved our lives  The bedtime route is &quotYou girls ready f bed&quot  Walk upstairs kiss them good night  set them  their cribs  They lay down  go to sleep takes about five mutesGREAT BOOK f parents of multiples
The Babywise practices promote flexabily  route  nurturg care of fants  It focuses on establishg optimum feedg/wakg/sleepg cycles through attentive  sensive response to your fants needs  A Babywise parent listens to every cry the fant utters assesses the suation  tervenes appropriately understg that there are many reasons why a baby cries   is their duty to vestigate  respond  a timely fashionI have followed all the prciples  Babywise wh my first bn son who is now 5 months old  My breastfed baby is THRIVING  His growth  weight  length are off the charts  Everyone who meets him comments on how happy  contented he is  He began sleepg through the night at 2 months on his own wh no coersion  When I lay my baby down f a nap  f the night he falls asleep on his own whout cryg  he wakes up coog  happy  Because my baby is well rested he has not suffered any illnesses of any kd even when my husb  I experienced the flu  colds  Am I just lucky to have an &quoteasy&quot baby?  The answer is NO  We wked hard to research the issues read  UNDERSTAND the prciples set fth  Babywise  implement them wh all the lovg care we are capable of because we want the very best f our son  Babywise prciples are  complete harmony wh AAP guideles  do not contradict any recommendations my doct has given me  I am very thankful f the Babywise books  how they have helped me to cultivate a healthy happy baby
I have used this book wh both of my children   wks  Both were sleepg by 7 weeks (my first)  6 weeks (my second)  It defely goes agast the child-centered md-set of most parents these days  that's why  is SO controversial  This book is a GUIDE  That's all  As wh everythg a ltle common sense goes a long way  You shouldn't follow  down to the letter  But that's the case wh everythg  I gave this book 4 stars stead of 5 because I don't thk  is the best plan f breastfeedg  But  you are breastfeedg this plan is the one I would wk toward once you get your milk established  I highly recommend the guideles  this book  People were amazed at how I could lay my baby down  her crib fully awake  have her go to sleep on her own
This book is a must have f parents who value their marriages children  a stable home leThe friends that I have that contued to breastfeed throughout the first year all used Babywise  I can't thank them enough f recommendg   As a teacher  as a mother I make sure to recommend  to all of those exasperated moms out there
My we  I read this book together when our son was 7 weeks old After carefully readg the book we decided that the ideas presented  the book were wth tryg Our son stantly fell  le wh the steps mentioned  the book Was he starved?No Was he neglected?NO Any good parent can discern the dference  the tone of their new bns cryg This book is not f everyone but I thk that most new parents can fd  very useful when the book is read by someone who first  femost possess good common sense whout  you will need a lot me than a book to assist you  rasg your childOn a side note: Our son was NOT breastfed so I can not dispell preivous reviews about the starvg of children What I can attest to is the fact that our son is now almost 3 years old  the 95 percentile  heigth  weight  lives  a very lovg family
Not only is Gary Ezzo a quack but he's a dangerous quack He has NO medical qualications whatsoever  Parents who look at this man as a parentg expert should really get themselves some expert advice  I read this book  found  hryg but not as hryg as his other wrgs where he goes so far as to recommend neglectg isolatg  even htg your children
We were given this book when my son was 5 months old  was not sleepg through the night In fact he was wakg at night about three to four times a night I was also was taught that when he cried I was to feed him So I did My son had problems wh gas  sptg up all the time After readg this book  two days-very easy readg our lives really changed We got onto the route   wked wh a week Our son was sleepg through the night-no me night time feedgs  he had less gas because we were feedg him on a schedule rather than every time he cried He also stopped sptg up so much I look back now  the reasons f him sptg up  havg gas was because we were feedg him too often too much  We just have nothg but wonderful thgs to say about this book I am pregnant wh our second child due  August  we plan to follow this book from day one I strongly urge new parents to read  follow this book  And f those of you who thk that because you follow this book that you won't have a bond wh your child-that's a JOKE!! My son is now 3  he is the most loved ltle boy  he knows this He has a very happy healthy bond wh both myself  my husb
First of all I dislike Gary Ezzo's tone He comes across as very sarcastic arrogant  condescendg  you have a dferent parentg style My advice is to remember that this is one man's opion  not the end all be all He has no medical trag  certaly no type of trag when  comes to lactation issues Use your common sense  mother's stct to guide you
I bought Baby Wise after I found out I was pregnant wh my first child  I had three other lady friends who had bought the book  had used   Their children were all happy content  they were all sleepg through the night by the time they were two months old I decided to give  a try  It wks!!! My daughter was bn  mid-December  she was sleepg through the night by February  She has only awakened  the night a few times sce then  that was because she wasn't feelg wellI loved the book  am planng on usg  f all my children I would recommend this book f all first-time moms  f moms who are tired of dem-feedg your baby  I breastfed my daughter  I am so glad that I had this book to use as a reference
I would rate this book at 10 stars  I could A good friend gave me this book when I was pregnant She told me that  I read the book  did what  said that my child would sleep through the night at 6 to 8 weeks I did --  he did -- at 8 weeks exactly I bought  f several of my friends They did as structed  THEIR children slept through the night at 8 weeks too I would HIGHLY recommend this book!!
I'm a &quotstay-at-home dad&quot Usg this approach helped get the baby on a managable schedule  let us get the sleep we needed I refer back to  regularly as the baby grows older  the schedule changes Good practical advice
When I read this book I had a colicy baby  I was lookg f anythg to help my baby  I ideas  the book made sense to me  I thought they would wk  After weeks of tryg to follow a schedule -- I thought the book well 'stunk'!  The only thg I agree wh is Ezzo's statement that a baby wh true colic has testal distress  that stretchg out their feedgs can give their gut a break  I thk this is true -- but these babies also need their needs met ASAP  The me you let these babies cry the me air they swallow the less sleep they get  the me miserable they are  If your colicy baby is asleep after they eat -- let them stay asleep!!  My baby would usually have tummy trouble a few hours after he ate -- about the time when this book recommends puttg them to sleep  As the day went on  was only harder  harder f my baby to sleep  I'm ashamed that I stuck wh the program as long as I did  Buy Dr Sear's book 'The Fussy Baby  High Need Child'  In my md babies ( children) are to be held  loved  Givg them the secury of knowg an adult will answer their cries only makes them better children later
OK so you will read those who found this book ak to a parentg bible  others who found  &quothryg&quot  Frankly I would much me rather deal wh three tough nights  17 months of peace (they are currently 18 months old) than children who sleep  Mommy's bed out of (bad) hab  cannot fall asleep whout a bottle  other aids wouldn't you agree?   This book helped us still sound sleepg habs from birth but as wh any parentg technique use common sense to temper what requires adjustment  your own home
I can't believe there are so many Mothers ( Fathers) reviewg this book as the &quotanthesis&quot of how NOT to raise your child  They obviously have very po readg comprehension  they thk the auths of this book are suggestg you let your child &quotcry  out f up to 45 mutes even  they're hungry&quot  Give me a break!  This book not only helps you figure out a plan as a new parent  reerates the &quotcommon sense&quot we need  der to feel confident about BEING a new parent  Puttg your baby on a schedule just makes sense as long as you follow the steps  listen to your baby  My baby was on a 25 hour schedule   helped me to plan my day so that I wasn't always feelg so frazzled  I knew what to expect as a new mother  so did our baby  Very ltle chaos  lots of time to enjoy our baby  And believe me our ltle guy is now 25 years old  VERY loved!  Those of you who thk this book is tellg you to fget your &quotmotherly stcts&quot are beg foolish  If you can't read between the les you shouldn't read this book  The structure  a family heirarchy SHOULD be parents as #1  #2  child as #3  When your child leaves the nest at 18 will you have your spouse stg by your side?  That's up to you!  Believe me 'll save your marriage durg the tryg times as a new parent
If I could rate this book wh zero stars I would  This book  a nutshell recommends arbrarily settg a schedule f a newbn  then fcg this helpless baby to stick to this schedule REGARDLESS of the fant's physiological needs  The auth attempts to back up his posion wh medical &quotfacts&quot  The majy of these facts are opions that are not ced  referenced  any way  In fact most of the current research  this field goes completely agast what this auth purpts cludg the recent statement on breastfeedg by the American Academy of Pediatricians  The auth's recommendation f not feedg a hungry child is ak to recommendg not changg a filthy diaper because 's not diaper-changg time as stated  the schedule  I am surprised the auth doesn't recommend tyg the fant  the crib to &quotensure the child learns that this is the proper place to sleep&quot  Honestly  these methods were used on an older child  an elderly person  a nursg home the &quotcaretaker&quot would be charged wh crimal neglect  However this auth thks strict schedule imposion at all costs is perfectly ok to fce on the most helpless of all creaturesa newbn child  I hope parents use their god-given common sense befe bldly followg the cult-like herd who sg the praises of this cruel man!  I have two beautul happy healthy boys  I would never dream of subjectg them to the methods  this bookthe guilt would be overwhelmg
This book is simply outstg!  We started this book after six weeks  our son has been sleepg through the night sce he was eight weeks oldSome people say this book is me f the benef of the parents than f the children but our son seems much happier now that he's sleepg through the night  I know we're much happier  are me awake  alert to care f him throughout the day
There is some valid cricism of this book which is the reason that I only reluctantly give copies to br new parents--both sgg the praises of the methods  warng not to apply everythg Ezzo recommends bldlyIf you overlook some of the advice Ezzo gives I thk the basic premise is very good
I thought this book was very good It helped us to get our baby on a schedual  therefe made our lives slightly me sane Our daughter is 10 weeks old  slept throught the night when she was 5 weeks old I use this book  the book &quotSecrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot as references Both have the same ideas as far as gettg them on a schedual &quotSecrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot says to go to the baby whenever she cries &quotOn Becomg Babywise&quot says to let them cry  out I thk there needs to be a happy medium between the two That is why I say I use them both Both agree that the baby should feed play  then sleep Neher tells what you are supposed to do  the baby falls asleep after a feed  you cannot get her to wake up
Pri to the birth of my first child  1999 I had heard of this book  I read the Amazoncom reviews both f  agast  People eher strongly loved   severely hated   It made  dficult to make a decision but not wantg to hurt my baby I decided not to buy the book  Image my surprise when our pediatrician at a pre-birth educational session suggested the PDF method discussed  Baby Wise  He had been recommendg  to his patients f 4 years  had also used  f his own children  He stated that of all of the children saw he could always tell PDF babies because they were better behaved  happierMy son will be bn any day now  I just re-read the book aga  He'll be a &quotBaby Wise&quot baby too  I hope that he is as happy as my daughter is
Gary Ezzo has no credentials  does NOT have a medical degree F your baby's physical  emotional health please don't buy this book
Someone gave me this when my ltle girl was only a week old It didn't make sense to me  I junked  Thank God a week later I found out that the American Pediatric Society (a far me reputable voice than a theologian when  comes to my child) discourages the Babywise method The fants that are beg breastfed on a Babywise schedule can suffer from somethg called Failure to Thrive This means that they are quietly starvg We moved on to other ways to parent Yes she nursed a lot  the begng but she grew she nursed less  I never had to fce her to cry to prove that I am boss I'm her mother I'd walk through fire f her why would I follow this irresponsible sadist?
I received this book as a gt  read  when I had my first child  I thought the methods sounded good at first but this book (someone told me  was igally called &quotRaisg Kids God's Way&quot???)is the only book I have ever thrown  the garbage  By readg the reviews I can see that the trag Bucknam wres about seems to wk f many parents  It wasn't the right thg f my husb my son  I though  If lettg your child cry  out feels unnatural to you I recommend readg reviews f &quotThe Baby Book&quot by William  Martha Sears to see which philosophy fs you better  Clearly &quotBabywise&quot  &quotThe Baby Book&quot are not anywhere near each other philosophically  Bucknam might make a reader thk that failure to disciple a six-week old is what's rug our young people but I have an affectionate  pole ltle boy who does not run our household despe the fact that &quotBabywise&quot went to the county dump long ago  I recommend that people look at the contents of both books carefully befe choosg one  the other

A co-wker gave me this book befe my baby was bn  I was exced because my brother  his we had already recommended   It was a great place to start from  Until I read this book I hadn't even thought about when to feed the baby etc  It has helped immensely!  Our daughter is now 5 weeks old  sleepg 5-6 hours a night--well on her way to sleepg 7-8 hours as she should  a few weeksIf you're havg a baby you need this book!!!  I'm buyg  f my expectg friends!
My husb's friend recommended this book to us befe our son Alex was bn  We read   were able to apply s lessons one week later  Alex started sleepg through the night after 10 weeks  he's the happiest kid I know  I'm always tellg my friends about this book  I don't know what we would have done whout   As a new mother I truly appreciated the fmation   was easy to underst  Children aren't bn wh the knowledge to underst their needs That's the parents job  This book shares fmation from breastfeedg vs bottlefeedg to how to keep your baby on a schedule which will wk f your family  It's not meant to be rigid  flexible 's meant to be used as a guidele from which to start  You change  apply what you feel you need to f your baby  I've also read the negative reviews on this book  feel that those people allow the baby to run their households  will only be raisg an overdulged child  will be payg f  later  My son is one year old now  we feel that he had the best start possible largely due to lovg parents  this book
Everyone will rave about your sweet baby after implementg this wonderful program to your babies le!  This is especially helpful to new mothers who have never wked wh a baby  the most imptant need of puttg your baby on a healthy schedule This book is almost like a hbook to babies  Our daughter was started on Babywise on day one  has been a gt to us  everyone around her  She is very predicatable  extremely happy  I kept this book  Babywise Two wh arms reach  was constantly consultg the wrg of Ezzo  Bucknam  We have a happy 8 month old baby who has slept through the night sce 9 weeks  takes two naps a day religiously Her sleepg has not been affected by teethg  illness  She loves her wake time  plays well wh other children adults  all by herself We couldn't image our le whout this book  we can't wa to have another baby!
I thought this book was a le saver f me  my family as well  I thk  gave us a sense of control stead of crazess  I felt like we were dog our baby a fav nothg neglectful  Our baby (our 3rd) wes noticeably calmer  me relaxed by the 2nd day of the program  My only problem was  lettg her cry  out f extended periods  I did adapt  a suggestion from the baby whisperer book which was to pick her up when she became upset beyond the pot of just fussg soothe her only to the pot until she stopped cryg them lay her down aga If I ever have to do this I usually only have to pick her back up once  twice I started babywise when she was 5 weeks she's now 13 weeks  sleepg peacefully through the night  I highly reccommend this book
When my son was bn I was taught to feed him when he was hungry  We were told not to wake him up  he was sleepg  Consequently we didn't feed him enough because he slept too much at first  Babies do not know what they need  is our job as parents to supply their needs  appropriate quanties  We did not read BabyWise until my son was a month old  By this time we had gone through the first stage where he slept  did not eat then he started eatg all the time  I was nursg constantly  I was a wreck  When I read this book I learned to put my son on a schedule  This does not mean igng him  not respondg to his needs  It does mean takg the active role of a parent  supplyg the babies needs whout over supplyg these needs  After we started usg this book our sons temperament changed to one of a happy baby who knew that he would be fed  taken care of  Consequently he did not have to fret  cry because he knew we were there f him  He is now 16 months old  loves to go to bed  eats very well  He is very healthy  was always a super chubby baby (even on a schedule)  This book did not make my le easier by lettg me igne my child  In fact  made  harder by havg to stick to a schedule myself  fd other methods of soothg the baby stead of stickg a bottle  his mouth
Pri to readg this book I was attemptg to follow the Sears school of attachment parentg  feelg miserable because I was failg on all fronts I had a fussy baby that cried all the time  couldn't be comfted I spent most of my day eher prayg he would go to sleep  parkg him  the swg to try to calm him By six weeks everytime he'd wake up cryg I'd start cryg because I felt like I couldn't face  anyme  After startg Babywise at 7 weeks wh 10 days my baby slept 8 hours straight wh another 4 after the feedg  Now we're gettg enough sleep  The bigger bonus is that he takes regular naps  his wake time is spent smilg  coog rather than cryg!  Contrary to many reviews you may read this book is not about igng a cryg baby  By puttg him on a schedule you learn to tell the dference between a hungry cry a sleepy cry a paful cry  you can respond appropriately which is much me imptant than just respondg I can now plan my day around the baby's schedule get thgs done  I have me time left to play wh my baby  My baby cries less  I don't cry at all!!  I must adm when I first read the book I was hesant to try the recommendations because  was so diametrically opposed to what I had been dog  But sce what I was dog wasn't wkg I took the chance - -  am still reapg the benefs!  I also recommend the Baby Whisperer book which gives good fmation on how to terpret babies' body language - really good f first time Moms
If you're lookg f an excuse to let your baby &quotcry  out&quot because you're too convenienced to be a good parent  follow your stcts - THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!!Please read a few psychology  child psychology books befe becomg brawashed by this garbage
We found this book particularly useful  solvg some of our baby's sleep  eatg problems  Befe readg  I was nursg every 1-15 hours  we were all exhaustedI pick  choose what wks f us always keepg our baby's best terest  md  let the results dictate what we do next  If  doesn't wk f our family we seek out what does
I am an avid reader  have read many books on the subject of newbns  This book has the most practical common sense advice I have read on how to put a baby on a feedg/sleepg schedule This book clearly explas the imptance of stabilizg your baby's metabolism from the 1st week by ensurg the baby is eatg at regular tervals  Helpful schedulg charts are cluded  the back of the book  It also gives wonderful advice on how to get your baby to sleep through the night  I wish I had read this book wh my first baby  My first baby had dficulty gag weight after readg this book I know  was because I let my baby nurse whenever she cried (whether she was cryg from hunger  somethg else) thus she was snackg  not gettg full feedgs Wh my next baby due to be bn  a couple of weeks I feel much me confident on how to get him on a schedule by usg the advice found  this book  Also this book makes an excellent gt f new moms  I clude a copy of this book as a gt to my friends at their baby showers!
This 1998 edion of Babywise is Gary Ezzo's second attempt to get  right  (The earlier edion was just published  1995)  This edion vastly improves on the scant research of the first edion  In the 1995 edion Ezzo provides only 10 footnotes  the entire book  Of these only two medical research articles are mentioned -- one from 1982  another from 1986   Neher of these articles are relevant to Ezzo's case f &quotParent-Directed Feedg&quot  gettg the newbn to &quotsleep through the night  by 8 weeks&quot  The newer edion does much better  -- wh at least 30 footnotes that cludes me current sources  One terestg change  the updated edion:  Ezzo revises his expectations f gettg newbns to &quotsleep through the night&quot from 5-8 weeks (1995 edion) to 7-9 weeksThis book raises a great deal of red-flags  new parents should be askg a lot of questions (especially from respected medical  family-advocate sources) befe jumpg head-first to this book   F starters I would suggest wrg  emailg the American Academy of Pediatrics the American Medical Association The La Leche League The Christian Research Instute  Focus on the Family
Several friends told us we must read this book  they were right  Our child slept through the night at 8 weeks  He is now 2 years old  is sweet lovg  well behaved  I recommend this book to all my friends
Several months befe I delivered my husb brought home this book  As new parents we had no knowledge of the controversy surroundg this book - we only knew that  we could get our babies to sleep throught the night early on  would be better f all volved  We read the book  then left  f several months until after I devivered  We then re-read   started puttg Ezzo's practices to place  It really wked! Wh 7 weeks both of our babies were sleepg through the night  are really happy attentive babies   I have heard that the ganization behd &quotBabyWise&quot is que controverisal  have heard alot of negative thgs about the program From what I have been able to learn through the ternet I would not be terested  that program  &quotBabyWise&quot is part of their outreach mistry  I found  was terric  As wh any book - use commonsense  use what fs your personaly
On Becomg Baby Wise is a wisdom filled book that every new parent should read It was given to us wh the birth of our first child  we didn't read through  until our child was about three months old My husb  I implemented the suggested schedule  our child was sleepg through the night wh three days We don't agree wh everythg they suggest but have followed most of  wh much success It's like any other parental advice use what wks f you Our child is very happy  secure sleeps twelve hours at night  naps durg the day whout protest It's about teachg your child self control how to go to sleep whout you  that food isn't the answer to everythg Children function best on a schedule they actually ga secury from   We wish our sleep deprived friends would give this a try
I have read  stuted the practices  Babywise  I got mixed results  He advocates an eat play sleep schedule which I still fd useful  However his methods are a b extreme  I found much me helpful advice  Dr Marc Weisbluth's book Healthy Sleep Habs Happy Child  He gives concrete fmation on how long a child of a particular age should sleep durg the day/night  how long they should be awake between naps  It has been a le-saver!
We wship this book  Befe readg  our son slept f three hour stretches had no schedule  was miserable  cranky all the time  Wh one week of implimentg the sound  reasonable advice  this book he was sleepg through the night  happy all day  He eats like a hse  at 9 months tops 23 pounds even though he was bn one month pre-mature  To say that the advice  this book is &quotdangerous&quot is completely nutty  Why is  that so many people who use the baby wise method seem so &quotlucky&quot  have kids who are happy  well behaved- who sleep through the night every night take their naps whout a fuss  are happy  playful the rest of the time?
This book SEEMS great  you are havg your first baby  You'll thk you have a plan are ready  have your hbook  Not so fast!  This book could be dangerous  the experts agree  It does have good advise about makg the parents' relationship the center of the family (not the child)  about gettg your baby on a schedule  However  dems that you supress your stct to go to your baby  he/she seems  pa  otherwise needs comft  It goes as far as callg you weak  you go to comft her  This is a b drastic  If that baby needs you  you feel the need to go to her you go!  She could be scared  gassy not just manipulative  We don't need this guy makg us feel guilty f gog   My 2 kids have been sleepg through the night sce 10-12 weeks old  still are at 3  1 year old  Get a book that helps you not supresses your stcts  Pass on this one
My child slept through the night after 7 weeks  Although we didn't follow this book like robots we found  contaed some prciples  helpful tips on easg our baby to helpful sleep patterns  After 4 months he slept 11 hours per night had a consistent 4-hour sleepg schedule  was a very very happy baby  I recommend all parents read this book compare  to other me tradional wisdom  decide f themselves which aspects rema relevant to them  Then proceed humbly through the first several weeks  not fever
AS others have stressed the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a warng on this book's feedg schedules  Especially  you are breastfeedg baby will not thrive  you go 3 hours between feeds  from a lot of the testimonials cg success wh 5 to 8 week old babies on sleep about 6 weeks is when mom's baby blues wear off  That is also when your milk supply is me established  baby automatically went longer 2 to 21/2 hours between feeds  What about baby's growth spurts  brgg up my milk supply  I don't feed him on dem?  Why would one go totally agast nature?Around 3 1/2 months he started sleepg many nights f upto 6 hours Around 5 months he automatically matured enough to want to go upto 3-4 hours(especially wh his 2 hour afternoon  eveng  naps) between some feeds whout complat   yes  is good to teach them to fall asleep on their own You can do that wh no tears! And yes set limsa simple one he learned wh a couple of days at 4 months is not to be/teethe while feedg :-)
I'm not a pediatrician but I am a mother of six children  The first four were fed &quoton dem&quot  became very demg toddlers/children  A friend gave me Baby Wise when I had my fourth child  all I can say is &quotWhat a dference!!!&quot  My last two children are calmer me generous me affectionate  me self-discipled   Much of the content I had already figured out from trial  (a lot of) err wh the first four children  I kept sayg to myself &quotwhy didn't someone tell me this f my FIRST one!&quot  It certaly would have saved me a lot of sleepless nights ( days!) I now give every new mother I know a copy of this book - no nursery should be whout !
I don't even want to give any stars f this book  His research clams are flawed  Many  not ALL child development experts warns agast his method of raisg a baby  You are puttg your baby at risk f death / permanent emotional damage  you follow this book  American Academy of Pediatrics has wrten a fmal warng agast this book  Many docts have seen &quotfailed to thrive&quot babies due to this book  This book is f parents who wants to raise their baby by fcg the baby to their lestyle stead of underst baby's nature  As a Christian mom I highly disagree wh this book  The auth is kicked out from the church where he was an associated past  HE's not even daed  Many christian docts pasts warns agast this book  You are settg yourself f bad parentg practices
I do believe that  is imptant to have consistancy wh children of all age  In that respect I agree wh this book's message  I must say that as a health care professional there are a few concepts mentioned  this book that make nmal feedg  growth patterns dficult to follow  Exclusively breast fed babies have feedg patterns that are called &quotcluster&quot feedgs  Cluster feedgs occur durg the first few days of le  at every growth spurt  A cluster feedg is characterized by several (2 to 3) small &quotmeals&quot wh a 1 to 2 hour time frame followed by a 1 to 2 hour sleepg  wakeful period  Many families that are tryg to exclusively breast feed become frustrated when the baby won't get on a &quotschedule&quot when really the baby has his  her own feedg schedule that's nmal f his  her growth requirements at the time  just may not follow a clock  Exclusive breast feedg is what is nmal  best  f a family to succesfully achieve an exclusively breast milk diet f thier ltle one a cyclical eat-play-sleep program may not be effective  Babies have an nate drive to get their needs met  we listen they will show us what they need
Although controversial the prciples set fth  this book  put to use  our home has resulted  a baby who sleeps through the night (begg at 9 weeks) is well nourished  healthy  is contuously happy  smilg  This program may not be f everyone but  sure has made our transion to parentg much easier
I read Babywise when my daughter was 2 weeks old  She is now 4 months old  sleeps through the night I don't need to rock her endlessly  nurse her to put her to sleep  She is a content  happy baby gag weight  thrivg  I know the prciples of Babywise helped me  developg my parentg style  Do I follow the book whout any deviation ever?  No  I've taken the advice of Ezzo  Buckman  cpated  wh my own common sense to develop a route that's comftable f my baby my family  myself      If you're an advocate f child-centered parentg don't disregard this book entirely  It may just offer you some suggestions that you can cpate to your parentg style
I was given this book by someone I judged to be sensible  known expert on early childhood education  The tone of the book was immediately disturbg to me  some of the statements that the auth made sound like facts I knew were not  I did some research  found out that this book is pretty controversial  has at least 35 unsubstantiated medical statements  the research fdgs that Ezzo ces  &quotOn Becomg Babywise&quot are based on GFI's own unpublished self-conducted studies There has been no peer review of his research which means no professional dependent expert  ganization has evaluated the fdgs  American Association of Pediatricians has warned that these methods may lead to a failure to thrive  fants  I do not argue that you cannot successfully teach your child to sleep usg Ezzo's methods I do question the cost to children  dog so  Please see [] f me fmation
The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued an alert agast the type of parentg recommended  this book The auth is not medically-traed Pediatricians have observed many children reared  the fashion recommended by the auth to have problems such as sufficient weight ga dehydration  dficulty thrivgDr William Sears' The Baby Book  Nighttime Parentg offers much me healthy sleep  parentg advice f babies  their families He is a pediatrician  the father of several children  offers a balanced view to child rearg
If you love your child do not buy this book Do not buy any books wrten by the Ezzos  their traed puppet Bucknam These people are dangerous  my heart aches f the babies who have been raised usg the cruel cold uncarg techniques promoted by this group of quacks
A friend had mentioned Babywise to me when my baby was only a week old but I thought I had all the answers!  I wanted to co-sleep wh my baby  feed her on dem  That's what all the &quotexperts&quot had recommended(cludg the lactation consultants at the hospal--although my baby was put on a 3 hour schedule by the hospal staff!)  I have several friends who have chosen to co-sleep wh their babies  Some of them still sleep wh their 2  3 year old children because their children are unable to sleep  their own beds  Others have eventually been fced to let their babies &quotcry  out&quot f up to 2 hours!  I don't see how the gt of sleep can ever be considered cruel  harsh  Fcg a child to become totally dependent on a parent f their sleep seems less desirable
I have told so many people about this bookwe have a 6 mo old who is happy chubby  thrivg!  She laughs so much!  I can't image not havg her on this schedule  The book is wonderful!  A must-buy
This is a book of PRACTICAL COMMON SENSE future adult raisg! (Because when you come down to  you ARE raisg future adults)  We as a society need to desparately teach our children lovg disciple  We give our children lims to show our children that we care about them as dividuals  There are lims  laws  every aspect of our lives religious  secular  The sooner we learn about lims  the consequences f breakg them the better  It is me HUMANE to learn this lesson early then when the results are me dire  The Ezzo's at no pot  this book recommend neglectg your child  ANY resonable person who has read the book would deduce the same  In response to other books denoucg this method of child raisg  I say this:  You can fd any book sayg exactly what you want to hear  you look long enough  My children are babywise babies  complete successes  Straights A's at one of the top schools  the nation lovg adult males wh a mal  social conscience  very spirual people  I've had many people approach me from the time they were fants envyg my relationship wh my boys  the lovely temperment they have  Teachers have asked me to help them wh their classes because of our rep  their exceptional perfmance  The Ezzos  Dr Bucknam provide GUIDELINES which you must temper wh wisdom  To bldly follow any book to the T would be irresponsible parentg  just pla stupid  These are children NOT RECIPES!  And to all those raisg 'Child-centered' children:  I've met their predecesss  they are the most self-absed ego-centric people you'd never want to know   And the AMA is NOT the femost authy on what is best f your child    The AMA is a non-prof ganization made up of physician most are not pediatricians  They &quotrecommend&quot a lot of thgs your job as a parent is to research  make your OWN decision  Not all their &quotrecommendation&quot have been good (IE: Phen-Fen) Good Luck to future parents tryg to make  rational sound parentg decision  It would be hard to fd a better book than this
I am currently expectg my second child  bought this book based on 's tle only hopg to educate myself as to gettg my baby to sleep through the night  I wish I'd read some customer reviews first!!  After a few pages of readg  this book I began to feel very guilty about the sleep patterns of my first child  We had let him sleep  bed wh us f a while  at 19 months he still needs us f comft as he falls asleep at night  This might not be ideal but I don't thk my child is on his way to an undiscipled le of confusion  Please read up on Ezzo befe you read this book  I thk he offers an terestg perspective  I'd like to try a (very) few of his suggestions but I want to read a lot me befe I try anythg  It's hard f me to praise an auth who contradicts himself  talks of flexibily  strictness gog h--h  Babies do need route  schedules  predictbabily but they also need attention  love  Sure I'd love to get my kids to fall to le  follow my own personal schedule but I know that parentg volves sacrices  I'm willg to make them  And I'm NOT sacricg my relationship wh my husb because of that  I urge readers to take Ezzo's fmation lightly  read me than just this one book
Wow!  This book saved our sany  We found out we were havg tws when I was 3 months pregnant  We stepped up our search f parentg books at that pot We knew we were really gog to need help  My tws came two months early  spent 1 month  the hospal  When they came home they were still 1 month early  Because they were still so early we waed until they reached their due date to start usg the advice  Babywise  We were losg our mds wh all the night-time feedgs  knew once they got big enough that was gog to have to change When they fally got big enough we made the gradual swch to no me night-time feedgs   was easy  They are now 3 months adjusted age old  have been sleepg through the night f over a month They are happy when they get up  the mng  spend alot of good alert learng time  It has made all of the dference  the wld  I also liked that  stressed that your relationship wh your spouse is extremely imptant  as a mother you shouldn't focus your le around your child to the exclusion of your spouse  I have already purchased book two  read   There is alot of common sense stuff  there that I plan on usg  As wh any method remember to take from  what you want - you don't have to do everythg they recommend
The technique that the auths recommends is effective I'm sure but the baby truly is beg &quottraed&quot (much like you would tra an animal)  From personal experience I can tell you that &quotchild-centerd parentg&quot wks wonders  While all of my friends who had babies at the same time as I were tellg me hr sties of guilt shame  wry over igng their babies cries so that they would &quotlearn&quot to sleep the question/concern of &quotsleepg through the night&quot WAS NOT EVEN AN ISSUE THAT I THOUGHT OF  That's right  My baby slept wh me  night-wakg was not an issue  It is also me practical to roll over  nurse a baby than to get up go to another room  feed a child  (One would thk that less-stressed less-tired parents would be less prone to beg abusive  sht wh their children too!)  In addion the idea of schedulg feedg that the auths promote is ludicrous!  (Please also notice that the auths of the book are MALESwho by way of nature are not &quotequipped&quot to feed fants anyhow  who's ma readg audience is women who mostly care f children how to parent  I am NOT EVEN a femist but books on childcare wrten to women by men is as ridiculous as male gynecologists  my book  Thk about )  Contrary to the book babies are me content when fed when hungry (wouldn't you be?)  Contrary to the book's proposal that &quotchild-centered child-rearg&quot brgs up demg bratty toddlers children who are cared f  loved (but who also have lims) are me respectful  willg to comply wh adult/parent authy (Studies have actually confirmed this) I defe lims RATIONALLY you know not lettg the kid draw on the walls not lettg the kid yell etc NOT by isolatg the child at night  by schedulg feedgs  Also studies have shown that caressg hugs kisses etc are good f  stimulate baby's grown  In addion studies have shown that sleepg wh your child will 1) help start/keep a regular breatg pattern f fants 2) codate parent/child sleep cycles  Aslo studies have shown that stress creases one's risk of becomg ill (stress hmones are bad f the immune system)  So the decision is let your child cry  out be secure learn that mommy  daddy won't come  meet their needs (they are NOT big planners manipulaters  thkers at this agetalk to a three-year old even they aren't much of one by that age eher) be stressed  look f signs of hunger squirmyness rootg grimacg face etc BEFORE the baby starts to cry  teach the child that they are secure taken care of loved  keep their anxiety level down  Now f a great book on why to parent &quotchild-centered&quot read OUR BABIES OURSELVES by MEREDITH SMALL  Also read MOTHER AND CHILD by JAN REYNOLDS  Other good books are THE BABY BOOK by DR AND MARTH SEARS as well as THE FAMILY BED by T THEVENIN  TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR CHILD'S HEALTH by DR WOOTAN  These books are highly fmative  will give you a great perspective as to why  is BIOLOGICALLY/EVOLUTIONARILY smart to use &quotchild-centered&quot child-rearg  Baby Wise is terestg  aga I'm sure the tecnique wks (the auths went on enough about how  did/does) but HOW  WHY  wks aught to be considered too  The consequences of such child-rearg may not be the price you want to pay f a good night's sleep  (Which your would get anyway  your baby slept  your bed)  BTW the above books mentioned will give you a good idea of fant sleep cycles  why they are the way they are  (Also read NIGHT TIME PARENTING by DR SEARS f me fo on sleep cycles)
The practices  this book can be dangerous to you baby's health    If the American Academy of Pediatrics has an opion on the possible consequences of a book on a baby's health I listen!  Please read the article at Babycenter befe purchasg this book I purchased  read the book  I was uncomftable wh some of the auth's suggestions  decided  wasn't my parentg style  I later came across the Babycenter article  threw the book away  There are lots of other effective me compassionate techniques f helpg your baby sleep  I followed T Berry Brazelton's advice f establishg a healthy sleep cycle f my fant wh excellent results
I would recommend this book to any parent who wants to sleep through the night aga!  Our son's pediatrician recommended this book to us at his 6 week appotment but we igned the advice  After she recommended  aga at his 2 month appotment we decided to give  a shot  He was sleepg through the night wh 2 weeks of puttg him on the Baby Wise schedule!  The only complat I have about the book is that they are pretty vague about how the schedule should change as the baby gets older  I guess by that time they should be sleepg through the night so 's not such a big deal  I am a true beleiver  the Baby Wise schedule  will contue to recommend this book to family  friends
At 8 weeks old our baby was wakg every hour  a half we were tired but we were puttg up wh  Then when our pediatrician asked us  we were feedg the baby  der to put him to sleep  we admted that we were She said there's a better way  she recommended On Becomg Baby Wise She warned us that  is a contoversial approach but sce we trust her we followed the book by the letter IT WORKS! I love this book It saved our le At 2 month old we started the trag  now at 5 months our baby is remarkably easy gog - he puts himself to sleep (f naps  through the night) efftlessly  We are so greatful  highly recommend this book
When our baby was 8 weeks old he was wakg every hour  a half  the night We thought this was nmal until we vised our trusted pediatrician She asked us  we were feedg the baby to lull him to sleep  we admted that we were She said there is a better way which will make him me self-sufficient  better rested She told us to buy this book  after followg the 24 hour schedule  recommends 's a miracle!! We have an efftless time puttg him down f naps  he sleeps through the night He is very well behaved cheerful  we are so happy I recommend this book  s sequel very highly
This is an excellent book especially  you are a structured ganized dividual If anythg read both books like I did  make the decision f your self I'm sure you will fd your self  the same place I was leavg \\"Attachment Parentg\\"  become \\"Baby Wise\\"
I do not recommend this book because  is the anthesis of every motherly stct wh me Mr Ezzo recommends thgs such as lettg your baby &quotcry  out&quot f up to 45 m even  he is hungry simply because  is &quotnot time&quot (per a superfluous schedule) to eat As a new mother  chills me to thk so many people are followg the Ezzo's suggestions Befe purchasg this  any of the Ezzo books I recommend lookg onle at various theies  beliefs of the Ezzo's re: how to raise children (ie usg me-than-simply-a-firm h)--get out of the 30's  40's!
We began usg this book when out daughter was 10 weeks old  Until then we have been dem-feedg  not puttg her down f naps on a regular schedule  We had also just return from a very busy three week vacation to vis family  friends  We began a schedule on the first Monday after our return  saw results  two days!  Our daughter was very receptive to a schedule  cried f 15 mutes at the most when we would put her down f a nap  It is now the end of our first week  she goes down f naps  at night wh no fuss at all  She has even learned to enterta herself  her crib by talkg  suckg her thumb until she falls asleep  She is still not sleepg through the night but she is wakg only once  As a result we have a much happier fun-to-be-around baby  we are much happier calmer parents  We are able to get thgs done f ourselves now  f her  And have qualy time wh her when she is awake!Nowhere does this book advocate not feedg your child when they are hungry  lettg them cry  out  In fact the book mentions not lettg an fant cry f me than 20 mutes  to feed them when they show signs of hunger  You still have to trust your stcts  do what is best f your baby  Our baby rarely cries now  we now know how to recognize why  when she is gettg cranky because she needs to go to bed  This book has made a huge impact on our lives as new parents while allowg us the flexibily to enjoy our baby  ourselves!d maybe not-so-early) weeks  That's part of parenthood But as adults we hopefully can see that the day-to-day dficulties are me than outweighed by the joy  satisfaction of raisg a child meetg their needs as THEY convey them to US not vice versa Please just listen to your baby not the advice  this book  All  is givg you is permission to be less of a parent than you ought to be
I was given this book as a gt upon the birth of my 1st child  I tried the schedule   wked so well that my child cried a lot durg the day from hunger  woke every 3 hours at night f over a year  I fally went to dem feedg which solved the daytime problems completely but he still stuck to his schedule at night  He still has problems sleepg at 2 1/2  My new baby now 3 months old was dem fed from birth  is now sleepg f 9 hours at night  It just doesn't make sense that feedg on a schedule durg the day would translate to no feedgs at night  Generally this book is not one I would recommend  You can figure out the thgs you need to know by common sense
Let me add my voice to those who found this simple easy-to-read  gentle book a godsend!Love
This is the book that we started wh wh our sons  now  is the book we give to our expectg friends  Ezzo discusses the way to troduce schedules to your fant's le  how to create the best environment  which they may thriveThis is a must-clude  your parentg library
This book has some good ideas but the ideas need to be kept  perspective  The book seems to contradict self  many placesIn the end USE YOUR BRAIN  Like EVERYTHING ELSE you read pull from this book what wks f you
My daughter is now 17 months old  is a very good example of how this book does wk We purchased Babywise when she was 5 weeks old ( we were extremely exhausted from wakg up several times at night wh a newbn who would only nurse f a couple of mutes befe fallg asleep f another hour  so) As a mother of two young children now I really thk this book has made  possible f me to manage my home the best way I can I'm able to still take showers cook meals  spend time wh my husb while carg f the needs of my two ltle ones It's been a huge blessg to me ( the methods really aren't magical - they are just practical ways that parents have traed their kids f a long time) Just ask your grparents (who probably had a houseful of kids) how they did 
I am still amazed at the bad reviews f Babywise  It all depends on terpretations  I found the book EXTREMELY helpful  would recommend  to anyone  Use some common sense when readg   It is NOT child abuse  I found  to be a very healthy method when used crectly  Our daughter is now 2  naps  goes to bed f the night most times whout a peep  Use the book to f your le style  If you are uncomftable wh some of the suggestions don't use those particular ones  Overall the book is WONDERFUL  a god-send  I only wish I had read  earlier  After establishg a FLEXIBLE ( I stress FLEXIBLE  No where  the book do they der you to be a tyrant!) schedule our lives changed enmously  It was like night  day  We were better able to terpret our child's needs  were able to pacy the cry based on what we learned  Babywise  Babywise is beneficial f baby  parents alike  I HIGHLY recommend  to anyone that has the abily to read  wh an open md  who can use  to f their lestyles
I fd  hard to believe that God would let his child cry to the pot of exhaustion just to f his schedule  let his child go hungry because  was not time to eat yet I don't know any adult that could follow this &quotBabywise&quot schedule how can we expect our children to I would hope that parents research fully any method of parentg that they choose followg your natural stcts would be my suggestion Babywise is a way to TRAIN your baby 's pretty sad that we are trag babies  the 21st century Babies cry because they are hungry wet tired  just need love We need to stop treatg our children as an convenience I have researched this method  the effects on children parented this way I underst that every parent uses this method dferently but f those that stick to  100%  do not listen to their babies needs you are causg your child a letime of detachment  emotional  psychological problems Please listen to your heart  your baby!
I read this book at the urgg of my parents who raised me usg Ezzo-like methods  Suffice  to say I was appalled  Please people underst that your children are not ltle tyrants whom you must control  be controlled by they are *people* fmg their own unique identies  fdg their own niches  the wld  If you want to read a book which will help you fm a healthy parentg philosophy read the Contuum Concept by Jean Liedloff  Don't read this one
I believe the people who wrote such nasty reviews did not actually read the entire book No where  the book does Ezzo say to let your baby rema hungry He actually says to go ahead  feed your child I agree that  may seem harsh at first but  benfs the baby greatly What are you teachg your child  you feed them every time they cry They will seek comft  food f a letime I did not go full fce because I couldn't st to hear my baby cry f long I checked  on him every five mutes He still learned to go to sleep on his own I have to asked myself  all the people agast this book can say that It changed my le along wh my sisters who also used this method I'm a much happier parent  can now give the maxium love  energy necessary to raise my son
I thk this whole series of books by Ezzo take away from parents  It tells them what to do so they don't learn to trust their own stcts  Or tells them their stcts are wrong  This whole book is about how to make a baby f your schedule rather than helpg people realize a baby is a le changg event  It talks about trag rather than allowg the child to experience the wld  It also doesn't allow f developmentally appropriate behaviour  It's ridicules to thk a 6   7 month old baby should s  a high chair  not play wh/experiment wh food  In a nutshell I thk this baak takes all the power away from the parent so then they depend on someone else to tell them how to raise their own child  It creats an dependence on the auths  Run screamg from this book  Throw  away so no one else can pick  up at your garage sale
By the time my der f this book arrived my son was already sleepg through the night (at 11 weeks) despe not followg ANY of Ezzo's advice I don't thk I could live wh myself as a parent  I had let my son cry from the first week as Ezzo suggests He was very colicky  cryg much of the time anyways funny that didn't put him to sleep Ezzo suggests NOT rockg your child to sleep  not lettg him fall asleep while eatg He wres that happy contented babies are not bn that way but created by followg his method I'm SO GLAD I didn't read this book befe I had already learned the kder gentler way!
I would like to publicly apologize anyone I might have encouraged to use the Ezzo methods while I participated  some of their classes  In our Ezzo classes at church we were told repeatedly that the Ezzo methods were God's Way yes wh a captial G  that only Ezzo parentg was the Right Way We were also told that parents who DIDN'T use the Ezzo parentg methods cludg attachment parents would have spoiled self-centered children The Ezzos clude fictional descriptions of children  their books  course materials showg a child raised on THEIR methods as beg a perfect ltle angel  the child NOT raised on their methods as the one who pushes ltle kids off swgs  havg no consideration f othersF the parent who would like to raise a well-behaved  thoughtful child you don't need the Ezzo methods to achieve this Babies will achieve a route  eventually sleep through the night They have been dog so sce time began You don't NEED Babywise to accomplish this
We had heard many hr sties about cryg babies  sleepless nights befe we had our first baby  we were recommended this book to ease our fears  To my md the prciples that are given  the book make perfect sense A baby like most other people is comfted by structure  predictabily  lims  is not comfted by the fact that he has two cranky servants at his beck  callIn contrast the parents we know who subscribe to dem feedg often appear haggard  stressed wh a squallg brat slung around the mother's neck who she  dad are ever strag to pacy  Predictions are hazardous but I can't help but thk that 15 years from now those children will still be squallg  one way  another  those parents will still be strag to pacy them
I thought this book was a le saver  We have used this book wh our now 18 month old son  plan to use  wh our new baby daughter when she arrives It wks our son thrived on the schedule - emotionally physically  sleep-wise As another review said I'm also amused at the &quotcontroversy&quot over this book  the attacks from the Attachment Parentg camp  the accusations of &quotchild-abuse&quot I have a son that is happy well-rested gets all the love &amp nurturg that he needs If you're a parent I believe Baby Wise is a must-read!
Never have I seen such negativy expressed f a book  What's up wh that?  We have used the tenets expressed  this book wh unqualied success  It wks fants seem to thrive on the schedule - emotionally physically  sleep-wise  We also were rewarded wh a happy child  part from the book  the temperament of the child Nature  Nurture - both play a role  PDF is the right choice  I fd very upsettg people are beg told many untrue thgs about this book  Please read   try the techniques - you  your child will be rewarded wh full sleep cycles  content kids  What's up wh these folks that are NOT settg schedules f their children - children need us to set the timetables they thrive on structure  not the chaos of CDF
This is a useful book f those new parents who have received lots of conflictg advice read other baby books  want to round out their perspective on child rearg I had already read the DrSears 'Attachment Parentg' book  found the Babywise book helpful  terms of recognisg that there are all sts of dferent parentg styles out there (each by the way professed to be right by the 'experts') Once you meet your ltle baby you will fd out which wks best f you!  Overall I would recommend Babywise as a useful read  F all those opponents of the book out there I would only suggest that you keep an open md  you try  you may just see that  isn't really so evil after all!
I'm the mother of a five-month-old  a friend recommended this book to me shtly befe he was bn  I started readg while  lab  grew very exced about becomg a PDF mother  However thgs didn't go as described  this book  I found myself at a loss  The book is light on details  doesn't give any options when thgs don't wk as they describe  I'm glad that I'm flexible because this could have left me feelg adequate  the end  Another friend sent me The Baby Book by Dr Sears  while I really don't agree wh the &quotAttached Parentg Style&quot I was at least comfted by the volume of fmation providedBottom-le this book has 's shtcomgs  is not f everyone
Usg the techniques  this book allowed me ( my triplet daughters) to sleep restfully at 12 weeks  This  turn allowed me to go back to wk at 16 weeks  I can actually get thgs done around my house because I can plan around their schedule  They wake up  the mng (after 11 hours of soundless sleep)  from their naps happy  sce mom  dad are happy (because we can actually have a le outside of takg care of babies) we all have the best time durg playtime  My babies never see a grumpy mom  dad  Don't let dem feed advocates fool you that allowg your baby (babies!) to cry a few times as this book advocates will traumize your child  Once your child learns the schedule the cryg time is gonefever!  Havg a child cry as a means to get anythg (the dem fed way) seems me traumatic to the child  the long run
I got this book as a gt  thk  is ridiculous  If you are a cold-hearted human beg yes you will fd  helpful but then  you're that cold-hearted you probably shouldn't be havg kids at all  Gary Ezzo doesn't even have children of his own has no medical  any other type of trag  pediatrics  psycology  He is a quack  I also learned that followg the advice  this book has caused death  failure to thrive  many fants  This book has been denounced by the American Accademy of Pediatrics
This is a disgustg book!  I actually give  -5 starsThis methodology is gross  unnatural DANGER
Skip this one  buy the Ferber book on sleep stead  It still gives firm encouragement but wh a gentler tone  I used the Ferber book wh great results  My son was sleepg through the night at 8 weeks  Now he is 12 months  does not have the &quotmommyis&quot my Babywise friends' children have  I truly believe that they were allowed to spend so much time screamg (per Babywise) that they thk  mom leaves the room she is never comg back  I just dered the Ferber book as a new baby gt here on Amazon
My sister--law gave me this book to read when I was pregnant wh my first baby  I was not gog to read  because I thought that dem feedg was the way to go  What a mistake I would have made If I had followed my ial plan  I went through over twenty-four hours of lab only to have a c-section  the end  Believe me when I say I was wn out!  I decided to try the babywise method  although  was a ltle b tough to get my son established  his new route  was well wth our efft  My son began to sleep through the night at ten weeks old  I have girlfriends wh 3 year olds that still have not had me that three hours of sleep  These are the same girls that swear that babywise is &quotcrap&quot  One of my friends had to go on anti-depressants because she can't get enough sleep  she is at her ws end  My new baby is not que three months old  is also begng to sleep through the night  I put him down at 7:30 pm  he wakes up anywhere between 5  7am  He is content  happy  He hardly ever cries  when he does cry I almost always know wh seconds what his reason is  I have seen un-babywise babies that cry  whe almost non-stop  Their mothers almost always medicate them wh tylenol  motr  chalk up their fussess to teethg  a cold  I wonder why they don't see that their children are just completely exhausted?  How many of us could take a series of thirty mute to an hour naps all day  night  function whout beg cranky  cryg?  As adults we depend on many schedules  routes to make our lives wkable  We even schedule our own meals  sleep  What makes us thk that  is humane to give our children this same stablily  Every wd of the testimonials  the front of that book have come true f both of my babywise babies
As a general rule I sell used books here  at my local used bookste  This one however went straight to the trash to prevent another unsuspectg parent from pickg  up  If you must adhere to the &quotcry--out&quot philosophy there ARE much kdler gentler method books out there  Ezzo wants you to feed your baby accdg to a rigid schedule  He wants you to put your baby  s crib  walk away accdg to a rigid schedule  He even wants your baby's waketime to wk accdg to a rigid schedule  This book was igally wrten filled wh religious doctre  It was REreleased  1995 wh the religion removed to appeal me to the mastream public  Origally Ezzo's book said your baby should cry  out  s crib because of what might have happened  God had not igned Jesus' cries on the cross  New parents do not need the added stress of tryg to parent their child accdg to someone else's idea of what a schedule should be  If you're determed to buy this book at least make an fmed decision  Rather than refer you to specic ses simply go to your fave search enge  type  the name of the book  the name of the auth  You'll fd plenty of fmation  In the meantime  you're lookg f thoughtfully wrten baby books suppted by research  happy parents check out William Sears
Please don't use this book!  It's hrible  If you love your child don't treat him  her like this  I have a 14 month old baby  he does wake up occasionally  the night  Not a problem  I cuddle him  nurse him until he goes back to sleep  I knew comg  that parentg takes some wk  maybe a ltle sacrice  I comft my child when he cries - I hold him when possible  talk gently to him  I have never isolated him   I wouldn't dream of lettg him cry alone f 5 mutes let alone an hour  Sure a baby will go to sleep  you let him cry long enough  He will learn that no one cares that he is lonely  Learned hopelessness one auth has called   My child is not demg  I have always let him know I -  someone - would be there f him  now he is trustg secure  affectionate  He gets a ltle clgy when tired but otherwise is very dependent  happy  My husb  I love our baby  we want that to be the number one thg he knows  le  Parentg isn't easy   takes wk  sometimes a ltle self-sacrice but we knew that gog   Please don't buy this book   you already did get rid of !  Buy somethg by Dr William Sears stead  He wres about treatg your child lovgly
Please don't be fooled by the people who spew venom on this book  After all when you look at the variety of products recommended  produced by the Dr Sears crowd you can see they have a vested terest  gettg you to follow their philosopy  All this book has  md is givg you the knowledge  advice you need to raise a happy well-adjusted child  Everyone I know who has actually put the tenets of this book to use has sung s praises--there are no exceptions to this rule  I have to believe that the people who say bad thgs about  have not tried   Yes  is the hardest thg you can do to put a baby down when 's naptime  let them cry f 15 mutes but believe me you only have to do that a few times f them to learn a very imptant skill--fallg asleep on their own  If they don't settle down  that period of time you also have the confidence of knowg that somethg else is botherg them like a burp  beg too cold etc  In the long run this confidence  beg able to underst your baby's needs is absolutely essential  People contually marvel at my 3-month-old who not only has been sleepg through the night sce she was 7 weeks old but who is predictably stable  never fussy  We can take her to get-togethers wh our friends  even to church  she hardly makes a peep  Both she  her cous (also a babywise baby) are about the happiest babies on the planet  They smile  giggle all the time  don't fuss when 's naptime  bedtime-- let me tell you--that makes f the happiest mom  dad on the planet!!!
I have a 3 year old  6 month old but didn't read this until the latter was 4 months  IT CHANGED MY LIFE!!  I read statements like that at the begng of the book  thought yeah right  But the simple truth is I am now wkg smarter not harder  my baby is the happiest guy on the planet  The only thg I didn't like was the pious attude that  you don't raise your child like this he will turn out to be a sht-attention-span brat  But the practical how-to advice far outweighs any problem I have wh their confidence -- because  defely gets results
Babies are NOT supposed to sleep through the night!  Their small bodies need frequent nourishment  Sce breast milk is digested much me quickly than fmula breastfed babies NEED to be fed every 2-3 hours  Fmula babies can go a ltle longer between feedgs but not much  I read this book when I was pregnant  thought  sounded reasonable but when baby was bn I had much better results when I followed my stcts -- nursg baby when she's hungry holdg her when she cries  It is cruel to let a baby cry  They do not have the mental capacies to &quotmanipulate&quot parents as the Ezzos purpt!  There is ABSOLUTELY NO scientic research that newbns &quotlearn&quot from cryg  NONSENSE! There is a reason a cryg baby is upsettg to adults -- 's nature's way of ensurg the child gets the attention  NEEDS to thrive  grow!  The biggest problem wh this book however is that the auths make numerous medical-soundg claims that ARE NOT based on any research!  They sound authative but their claims are pure rubbish!  Furtherme Mr Ezzo is a fraud!  He has no medical  psychological trag  He is allegedly a mister although his educational credentials are also questionable  This book contas no bibliography which conveniently prevents the reader from dog any follow up research  Of course that is because there IS NO RESEARCH f a reader to pursue  I could go on all day but I hope I've made my pot  This book is trash
I really liked this book  I exclusively breastfed  found that what this book says is true: feed the baby on a schedule  breastffedg will be easier  the baby will sleep through the night  It's not just that  makes your ( the baby's le) simpler the schedule helps to provide the baby wh the stabily kids yearn f  the milk he needs  I recommend this book to any woman who is breastfeedg  wants to 1) sleep through the night  2) mata her milk production (even when she returns to wk)
Babywise is a good middle ground f moms you don't want to  can't have a baby attached to the breast several times an hour- but want the flexibily to trust themselves  listen to their baby's needs  Everyone we know who has applied the prcipals  this book recommended  to us wholeheartedly  The auths may seem harsh sometimes - especially to a new  unsure mom as I was - but one of the ma messages is FLEXIBILITY  The auths never say to leave a hungry baby hungry - just that a cryg baby is not always a hungry baby babies have other needs besides hunger  Your new baby will not starve on a 2 1/2 - 3 hour schedule (which by the way is a much me frequent feedg schedule than most grmas went by)  Our baby was small at birth  we woke her up every 2 1/2 to 3 hours to feed her f the first month  At 5 1/2 weeks she was sleepg 7-8hours at night  at 2 months she was  the 90th percentile f weight  height  She is thrivg happy  now at 4 months goes down at night  f naps whout any fussg
We received this book pri to the birth of our daughter from a friend who had taken a parentg course based on Ezzo's wk  It was THE most imptant gt we received  Everyone I know who has followed at least some of the recommendations on establishg a route  gettg kids to sleep has very very happy babies ( happy rested Mommies)  I know so many who tried to follow the dem-fed method carried their babies around f hours  a Bjn  spent a couple years tryg to get their kids to sleep  You can raise a healthy wonderful child usg any of the recommended methods  However  you follow Babywise you will also get a happy rested set of parents  And a child who doesn't learn he needs to scream f food
This is the sanized version of the book  which theologian Ezzo oms his reasong f lettg your baby cry whout comftg him  The other version quotes Bible scripture as proof of his assertions--Yikes! Ezzo is not a doct  the American Academy of Pediatrics has voiced their concern about the content of this book wh good reason  This man has no busess tellg anyone how to raise their child  Stay far far away from this book
Upon fdg that I was unexpectantly pregnant panic set I had no previous experience wh babies  children  I felt very uncerta about my motherg abilies  futureThe most confusg thg beg the diverse advice/warngs/ &quotold-wives tales&quot about babiesUpon receivg a copy of this book from a good friend my husb  I began to read  together Admtedly we were sceptical about the promise of a full nights sleep  the begng  But our baby was sleepg through the night by 7 weeks old due to the advice of this book  It's all common sense  cuts through the myths   convces you (most imptantly) that you are DOING THE RIGHT THING!!  Read this book follow the advice learn to filter the advice from relatives  friends  you're on your way to sany  We have given this book to all our friends who have sce fallen pregnant   has wked every time  Just dont give up keep followg !! You will have the most content  happy baby anyone your family  friends have ever seen!!
A great book  a great way to parent! Sure you can't take  all lerally  you have to use common sense But there's no shtage of good advice  solid parentg techniques We started usg this book on the late side but  wasn't long befe our tws could sleep from 7:30pm to 7:30am (yes that's 12 hours whout food water diaper changes  coddlg!) They can do   's very natural Best of all everyone is happier the next day!
The parent-directed feedg method described  this book really wked wh our second child  The advice f lettg your baby cry may seem harsh but  may be necessary to get him to sleep through the night  Our first child was nearly two when he began to sleep through the night but our second child began sleepg 7+ hours each night at around 3 months It's now not uncommon f him to sleep 12 hours at night
I am a mother of 3  NO good reputable pediatician would recommend such thgs as are listed  this book IF you LOVE &amp CARE about your child YOU will NOT get this  practice these EXTREME mesaures as discriped  this book This is pure &amp Simple CHILD ABUSE
I bought this book when my son was three months old because he was havg some sleep problems  we needed to end our family bed suation  I was appalled at the feedg schdule they advocated f breastfed babies  It goes agast what both my pediatrician  lactation consultant told me  Feed your baby whenever he's hungry  you'll know that he's dog well by the number of wet  dirty diapers he's havg  by weighg him periodically to make sure he's gag roughly half a pound a week  the first three months  Not feedg a child who's obviously hungry just because he ate 2 hours ago  not the book's recommended 3-4 is silly We taught our child to fall asleep on his own whout any kd of feedg schedule  whout abong comft nursg by readg Dr Richard Ferber's book Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems
I truly fail to see how this book gets such bad press How can your baby become &quotfailure to thrive&quot when you are followg the action plan  this book? You are feedg every 2 1/2 to 3 hours cuddlg  talkg to your baby while feedg her spendg at least one hour after daytime feedgs sgg to your baby playg wh her  teachg her how much you love her That equals at least 6 hours a day of one-on-one attention  at least 8 feedgs  a 24 hour period If you only read the part that said  is okay f your child to cry sometimes  let that be the only lesson you learned from this book you are just an idiot  a very po parent! This book stresses the imptance of flexibily to the schedule  common sense parentg As wh every parentg book you should use good judgement  decide what wks best f your child  you    We read this book when our baby was 8 weeks old The dference that  made  our lives was credible We had been lettg our baby fall asleep durg feedgs  immediately thereafter Once we started makg sure he stayed awake f about an hour after daytime feedgs he napped better  longer  wasn't fussy anyme  Befe that we were exhausted all the time  constantly passg a fussy baby back  fth He was just not gettg the right amount of qualy sleep As f the &quotlet your baby cry&quot statements read the book! You should be usg a clock  watchg how long your child is cryg We did not want to let our baby cry We only let him cry one night f ten mutes Then we went   gave him his pacier spoke to him softly  stroked his fehead He went to sleep From that night on he slept longer  longer Wh five days he was sleepg seven hours at a stretch His disposion changed dramatically He woke up happy  playful not screamg  cranky like befe Now at four  a half months of age he sleeps twelve hours a night  is a delightfulbaby We are always hearg &quotWhat a happy boy!&quot from everyone who sees him We know that  is because we are Babywise parents Read the book f yourself
 the description  says this book is &quot authative&quot? Well Ezzo is NOT a pediatrician  He has ZERO medical experience wh children He is a mister NOT a pediatrician!  Babies have been admted to the hospal f dehydration due to Ezzo's schedule feedg children have been removed from their homes because goodchristian parents have read  adopted the practices from Babywise Don't take my wd f -research Ezzo f yourself  fd out what he really is
F a first time parent wh nothg to compare to except friend's kids  nieces  nephews I have nothg but good thgs to say about this book  I bought  read the book befe I delivered  started the 2 1/2 - 3 hour feed schedule  the hospal  By 10 weeks my son was sleepg 8 hours  by 12 weeks 11 hours a night  Every night he goes to sleep whout a peep  most naps happen the same way  I can only attribute  to the methods  this book  My son is both healthy  happy  knows how the events of the day will happen  I never once felt like I wasn't dog the right thg f my family  I have loaned my book out to all my friends wh kids who were terested by my sucess  willg to give  a try  The auths were right people do say you're lucky to have a baby that sleeps through the night  I now know s not luck
Be very careful when make a decision about your fant  his/her sleepg  eatg needs  This book is very controversial  Just go to yahoocom  type  babywise to see a sample of the conflictg opions  I was very envious of the Babywise mom's  my mom's group  thier abily to sleep through the night Then I read the book by MR Ezzo (not Dr Ezzo)   sounded good to me  Befe proceedg wh his PDF plan we read the other opions (those of physicians  lactation specialists)  Mr Ezzo expresses facts  quotes that are completely unsubstantiated  can be dangerous  His rigid schedule of &quottrag&quot a baby is NOT &quotnatural&quot   We threw the Babywise book  the trash
My husb  I found this book to be a very useful guidele  We found the prciples to be useful when used  a consistent but flexible way We have highly recommended  to other parents we know I found the book to have a common sense approach wh lots of good advice f parents We are very happy that we read 
I was breastfeedg my first son  everyone was tellg me that I should fget about puttg him on a schedule &quotWhen you're breastfeedg you must do  on dem&quot  My husb  I felt that  was also imptant to put our baby on a schedule but how can we do that  we're feedg on dem  One day I picked up Baby Wise  a bookste  thought let me give this a try  I'm so glad I picked  up This book makes so much sense  It's so imptant to give your baby a route  they're much happier f   My son started sleepg through the night at 9 weeks  My second son was sleepg through the night at 11 weeks  They are 5  3 1/2 today  they have always had amazg bedtime habs  I recommend this book to all my friends that are havg babies  have also recommended   my book &quotBabyI Can Hardly Wa!&quot
Let me start by start by sayg I wholeheartedly agree wh the Parent Directed Feedg model We have a 2 1/2 month old daughter who is already sleepg 9 to 10 hours a night --  she's the happiest baby you'll ever see To top  off she even has reflux so we are extremely pleased that she is dog so well under those condions And we have plenty of friends who have used Babywise  their kids are great! The problem wh this book is that  needs a though edg to clary  crect the contradictions throughout the book The basic premise is very simple but they need to clean up the charts make the numbers consistent throughout Someone else (a GOOD wrer) ought to wre a book on Parent Directed Feedg make  smaller simpler me charts  schedules  they would have a wner on their hs But until that day Babywise is the best choice out there So  you want to raise a why demg self-centered kid follow the 'popular' Dem Feedg approach espoused by many of the liberal reviewers of this book If you want a happy healthy kid use the Parent Directed Feedg method promoted  Babywise

When my pediatrician advised me to beg sleep trag my baby I did my  research Prolact essential to matag milk supply is generated   greater quanties durg night nursgs Why would nature make this so?  Lactoferr a compound found  breastmilk but NOT  fmula kills the  strepmutans that cause tooth decay so rather than beg detrimental night  brestfeedg PREVENTS tooth decay But never md Nature's design: do the  CONVENIENT thg so you can watch your fave TV programs ON SCHEDULE
I wish I had known when my baby was bn that the American Academy of  Pediatrics  most baby experts are strongly opposed to the methods   this book Instead of followg my motherly stcts  carg f my  cryg hungry baby I enfced rigid schedules allowed my baby to cry   spent a miserable 25 weeks post=partum wonderg why I was so stressed  when this book had been so highly recommended And here I was followg   to a &quotT&quotAt my first checkup the doct was appalled to see  my lethargic son (who had not gaed any weight sce I left the hospal)   told me to head straight f the ER My boy was sufferg from  dehydration  was diagnosed failure to thrive I was thankfully given a  lot of wonderful  crect fmation by carg hospal staff   social wkers  the best thg i ever did was THROW THIS BOOK AWAY It  is dangerous I should have known all my stcts told me to hold   feed my baby when he cried I shouldn't have done otherwise Thank God my  baby is happy healthy today  he is now breastfed on dem  cuddled  all he wants  needs to be! It's not about &quotcontrol&quot 's about  beg lovg  kd to your trustg helpless baby
This book was given to me by my cous when I was 8 months pregnant  I  also had a copy of &quotThe Womanly Art of Breastfeedg&quot  I far  prefer Babywise  the methods  teaches  My 5 month old is the  happiest most content baby I've ever known  is the delight of nursery  wkers  friends who watch her As a new mother I was always concerned  &quotwhat does this cry mean? what is she tryg to tell me?&quot   Babywise helped me dferentiate between my baby's cries  respond  appropriately sometimes wh food other times wh a quick hug  gentle  rockg sometimes just puttg her down f a nap  never says to igne  a baby's cryg (beyond 5-10 mutes)  My daughter has been sleepg  through the night sce she was 8 weeks old (9-10 hours at a time)  not  through &quotfced&quot methods such as over-feedg befe bedtime  Anyone who cricizes this book f beg too rigid obviously did not read  very carefully  Many times Ezzo clearly states that the methods are a  guide only  parents need to be flexible  responsive to their  particular child's needs The only problem I had wh the book was the  emphasis on the first 3 months  referrg me to BabywiseII f me  fmation  I would like to see a me comprehensive discussion contaed   a sgle volume This book is a must-have f any parent who still wants  a le  doesn't want to be tied to the house because of their baby's  completely unpredictable wants
I am a first time mom  I bought this book about 2 weeks ago when my  baby was a month old At that pot I was pretty much nursg round the  clock sleepg on the couch wh Owen lyg on me so we could get a ltle  rest  so could my husb Durg the day I was holdg him  he was   the Snugli thg  he wasn't nursg  usg me as a pacer **2 WEEKS  LATER** after readg the book we are on a route he takes naps IN HIS  CRIB durg the day wh just a ltle cryg when I first lay him down  (not every time)  he is sleepg 7-8 hrs most nights  best of all we  BOTH know what to expect next (when we eatplaysleep) I can now plan  household stuff trips to the park grocery shoppg etc In response to  the negative reviewsUSE YOUR COMMON SENSEthe book is only to be used  as a guide  you  your baby have to be ready (maybe a few weeks old  not just home from the hospal) that way you know your baby well enough  to tell  he's is gag weight happy  a ltle about how  why he  crys This book has wked out great f our family I can't image what  thgs would be like whout  I wish my cous had told me about  when  I was pregnant
I am hried at all the negative comments that people have wrten about  this book!  I first heard about this book when a friend of me from our  bowlg league bought  when she had her first baby  This child was an  absolute delight to be around  He was sleepg through the night around  six weeks (&quotsleepg through the night&quot to mean around six-seven  hours)  just happy as could be  So I bought  f my first baby  she was sleepg through the night at six-seven weeks up to 9-10 hours  around eight weeks no I don't have a &quotsleeper&quot f a  child  And I'm not &quotjust lucky&quot  I am a practical LOVING  mother who bought to the prciples taught by this book  Namely that  this child is a welcome addion to the family but that we are NOT gog  to be child centered  You would not believe the compliments we receive  from just about everyone who comes  contact wh our daughter  She is a  delightful child who is a pleasure to be around  And no 's not all  &quotjust her disposion&quot  She was traed to behave the way we  want her to behaveshe was traed crectly the first time so that we  don't have to re-tra a bad hab ( no I don't thk of my child as a  dog when I use the wd &quottra&quot)  The problem wh so many  children today is that they were raised  a me-me-me environment  have  always gotten their way  To be a good parent you have to say  &quotno&quot sometimes  you HAVE to set boundaries  Otherwise you  will have a hr f a child whom no one will want to be around  Do you  know that my daughter has NEVER thrown a tantrum?  I attribute just about  everythg that has to do wh how my child has been raised to this man   his wonderful books  I have bought all three   he keeps 'em comg  I'll get them through adulthood
I read Becomg Baby Wise befe my now 2 1/2 year old son was bn  This  book was a le saver!  He slept through the night at exactly 8 weeks   by 12 weeks was sleepg 12 hours per night  I had another baby this year  who is now 5 months  also slept through the night at 8 weeks  Both kids  are happy very well fed great nappers &amp night-time sleepers  All  kids need some type of route  their lives  the best time to start  is right at birth  I've encouraged all my new mom friends to try this  method
I had heard the hullabaloo about this book  decided to give  a read  I was shocked! I never thought  would be as bad as  really is Cold   cruel  dangerous I answer breastfeedg help calls from people who  are dog Babywise  their children are DYING I am serious I have  gotten serveral calls from people whose babies were not wakg up because  they were starvg to death from usg this method Please read anythg  else
This book was recommended to me while I was expectg my first child by  friends who had a three month-old who was sleepg through the night When  my baby was 2 weeks old I read the book  one stg I have a  &quothigh need&quot baby who cried almost all the time f the first 6  weeks He used to fall asleep f about two mutes after nursg then  cried until the next feedg barely gettg any sleep After readg the  book I tried to keep him awake right after feedg  then let him have a  nap This did actually make thgs a b better but nothg like what my  friends described They have an 'easy' baby though  I wonder   anythg would have wked f them It would have been very helpful  he  discussed the dficult  colicky baby  perhaps what to do  you  have a baby who's constant cryg makes  nearly impossible to determe  when he's truly hungry  a baby who never falls to any kd of  schedule on his own He also shuns co-sleepg I never thought I would  sleep wh my baby but I brought him to bed wh me at two weeks planng  to transfer him to the cradle once asleep but when we both woke up  was  time f a feedg He fally slept well-- sleepg 5 hours the first  stretch He slept wh me until 8 weeks when we fally transferred him to  his crib We missed him the first few nights! I thk that Ezzo's they  has mer but the bottom le is you have to do what wks f the family   the baby
As a first time mom I found this book to be helpful as I found many books  to be helpful  I did not use  as a Bible  I took what made sense to me  (feedtime waketime sleeptime) out of   igned those ems that I  did not agree wh (lettg your baby cry himself to sleep)  As a wkg  mother who wanted to breastfeed her child I was discouraged by everythg  I read about feedg your baby whenever he wanted to eat  I heard too many  sties about feedg times beg unpredable  varied  This was the  first book that talked about puttg a breastfed baby on a schedule (which  is crical while I wk) Although I did not follow Mr Ezzo's timeles  I wked wh my baby to establish a route  I let my son guide me  Now  at 11 weeks my son is sleepg through the night is on a predictable  feedg schedule  I am able to contue breastfeedg  On top of that  he is very healthy  happy (our pediatrician just commented on how big   healthy he was)  Like any childrearg book you need to use common  sense  pick  choose what wks f you  But  you have such ltle  fah  your abilies to parent  follow this book as   were the  Bible on childrearg then of course you will have problems
The methods  this book wk  They wk not only to get your child to  sleep long peaceful hours (f both of you) but also to build a happy  confident child  My daughter is 10 months old  slept through the night  at 8 weeks  I hear the phrases &quotshe is such a happy baby&quot    &quotyou are so lucky&quot on a daily basis  That's the truth  Read the book  decide f yourself  It wks
That's exactly what  is a guide Common sense will dictate how you react  manage your specic suation based on your child's dividual  health  circumstances However this book provided my we  I wh  excellent guideles f raisg our child My daughter is now 15months  she is loved very much  is probably repremed less now because we set  some gund rules when she was younger My daughter goes to bed at 7:30pm   wakes up around 6:30-7:00am She is emotionally secure happy   loved My we  I have time to spend wh each other  the eveng   this is nourishg f our relationship Alot of  as a result to advise  from this book We are now expectg a second child  we will use this  fmation aga I strongly recomend you read   decide f your  self I have heard many people speak strongly agast s prciples  Usally when I look at their lives I can see the results of their choice   s not where I want to be
NO STARS!  This auth has been largely discreded by the medical communy childcare  lactation experts  the last three (3) churches  he got kicked out of!  The American Association of Pediatricians doesn't  recommend his 'parent-directed feedg' babies have been HOSPITALIZED  Do  they have to die befe people will listen?  This is BAD MEDICAL ADVICE   THIS MAN IS NOT A DOCTOR  THIS MAN DOES NOT HAVE EDUCATION IN THIS FIELD   THIS MAN HAS NOT STUDIED CHILD DEVELOPMENT OR HUMAN LACTATION  He is a  misogynist who's got breast envy  And don't thk this is Christian  It's  not based on the Bible just 'baptized' wh a few ill-chosen proof-texts   It's full of conflictg messages 's based on false premises (that AP is  humanist that humans do not have stcts  natural clations)  He  teaches parents to question their own stcts  to blame themselves  when the 'program' doesn't wk  He vilies other experts  his  crics  He's makg SCADS of money off secure firtst time  experienced parents  control freaks  It's cultic  Don't get sucked  !
As a mother of six wh over 20 years of parentg experienceI am deeply  disturbed by what I read  this book  It is filled wh  overgeneralizations exaggerations  falsehoods  The breastfeedg  fmation  contrary to current lactation knowledge  The psychology  fmation is accurate  It may &quotwk&quot f some babies but is   best f baby?  Keep  md that the auths call  an &quotfant  management program&quot which is exactly what  is  You won't fd much  value as far  love  bondg  relatg to your baby  this book
This book my be dangerous  followed too closely especially f  breastfed fants  It is also cruel to children because  advises parents  to igne their children's cries  It advises women to breastfeed their  fants no me than every 2 1/2 hours However when fants go through  growth spurts which may occur at any time they need to be fed me  frequently
I have successfully traed my two children to sleep through the night  usg the Ezzo method - one at 6 weeks  one at 10 days I thk he is a  wonderful wrer  has a ton of hs on experience to back him up I  don't underst why all the &quotcrics&quot out there have such a  problem wh  You must read the book as a guidele  use your common  sense to make the fmation wk f you I guess you are too sleepy to  make good decisions sce you have been up all night wh your fants  Best of luck!!!!
This book was recommended to me by a pregnant friend while I was pregnant wh my second child  Wh memies of sleepless nights  hectic unpredicatable days from my first I was open-mded  terested based  upon my friend's description of the book  As I read this book a sick  skg feelg grew side my heart  How could anybody a treat a fant  this way?  This book should be called &quotparent-centered&quot   &quotparent convenience trag&quot  I got through the first book   was appalled  I had purchased the follow-up book at the same time I bought  this one so I opened  to even wse advice  hrible recommended  treatment of children (like  your toddler is not potty-traed by 18  mos they should be required to clean themselves up  they soil  themselves! )  This guy is nuts  as far as these people that flict  this treatment on their children:  &quotnever underestimate the power of  denial&quot
Accdg to Dr T Berry Brazelton MD (who also wres helpful books f parents) this approach shows credible lack of respect f your child  Listen to what your own stcts are tellg you - your child is  not bn to this wld to make your le miserable  to manipulate you   If your child is cryg -  wants somethg from you - most likely comft   affection  There are ways of gettg a good nights sleep that do not  require you to let your child cry until they are consolable  ways of  fosterg good manners  behaviour that do not require you to emotionally  abon your child Your child is only this age once -  the sleepless  nights will be soon enough over when your child is ready  You will miss  these days when your child is a teenager  wonder how you could have  thought them a problem  I sympathise wh parents who are facg lack of  sleep  other problems but remember: you only get one chance to do this  right --  teachg your child that you won't be there when  needs you  is NOT the way to do  Buy Dr William Sears book stead
After readg the cricisms of this book I was hesant to purchase   Wh my first child on the way I was tn between the testimonials of my friends who swe by   the reviews by parents who equated  to child  abuse  In my 8th month of pregnancyI read Babywise cover to cover then  put  aside  2 weeks after my baby was bn I reviewed   much to my  surprise found that my daughter was already startg to follow the plan   She is now 6 1/2 months old breastfed  has slept through the night  sce 4 weeks Everyone who meets her comments that &quotshe is so  happy!&quot  And so are her parents  We're not experiencg the sleep  deprivation that  seems so many new parents do  And by the way I didn't  fd anythg cruel  harmful  this book  It does promote a regulated  pattern but frankly as a first time mom I've found the pattern very  helpful  supptive
Beg a new mom  seekg all advice on becomg a good mom I have tried &quotthe babywise technique&quot among others My girl cried 20 m the first night 5 m the second night  1 hour the 3rd night  afterwhich I run full of tears  broken heart to cuddle  comft  her  I have noticed a change  her  the mng she was extremely sad  as nmally she is a very happy baby I felt like I let her down I swe I  will NEVER let her cry to sleep aga I now believe all babies are  dferent some will sleep through the night some won't  some will  sleep sometimes The fact is that each baby has dferent needs  there  is no way on earth you will teach your baby to fall asleep on her own   she just does not She might need you   you are not there you will  loose her trust  therefe her happessI cannot believe that this  book was published  the Uned States  is available on bookste  shelves labeled f &quotbaby care&quot where an advice seekg mother  hopes to fd docts help  carg f her newbn  I thk there is  somethg wrong wh American system to allow this to happen This book  should be labeled as &quotfiction&quot   I also blame myself f  trustg the system  not dog the research I have done afterwards   thank God I followed my stct
Someone gave me the Babywise book  befe I read  I came to this se to read some of the reviews on  After readg them I came to the conclusion I would have to read the book just to see what all the  controversy is about  Sce readg  I have realized that the people  that are agast  didn't want to like the book  the methods  the  first place They consistantly put down the auth as beg a tyrant   bderg on be an abuser of babies They took just about everythg he  said  twisted  to what they wanted to hear to justy their  cosleepg constantly holdg  makg the baby the center of their  family rather than an equal part All I can say is the auth constantly  says to mon your baby your milk supply to make sure he is gettg  enough to eat  know your baby's crys He never said let your baby cry   cry  cry He said usg his methods you will be able to tell what  kd of a cry  is  when to respond as necessary He also said  is  fe to go   comft your baby He also stated no one should use the  clock as a soul source of when to feed your baby He made suggestions f  dferent suations He even said God fbid that you are the parent   the decision is yours on how you want to hle suations that arise--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me first qualy my remarks by sayg that I've been wkg wh various types of dysfunctional families on a professional level f over 29 years now cludg wk  the fields of Child Abuse Prevention  Drug  Abuse Prevention I'm also the father of two adult childrenIn the spir of the teachgs of Jesus Christ please believe  that you can be a good Christian whout igng the needs of your babies   beatg your children to fearful submission
As a new mom I purchased this book thkg  would help me learn how to get my fant to sleep longer at night  Readg this book made me feel like a failure as a mother f not havg my 7wk old on a rigid three hour  schedule of feedgs  nappg  Ezzo &quottalks down&quot to mothers   has an attude of &quotthis is simple what's your problem&quot  leavg no room f the dferences babies have right from the begng  If you'd like a helpful book on sleepg read the Weisbluth book which has  parent's personal sties as well as scientic data  research  Please  do not buy this book f a new mom
My first child is now four months old  has been sleepg through the night sce she was seven weeks  I used this book to learn about how to feed her to get her to sleep through the night when she was first bn   now I am usg  to learn how to troduce solid foods  It is easy to  read  underst  In fact I have certa pages marked to refer back to  from time to time   My baby is happy well rested  growg like a  weed  This strategy is wonderful f parents who would like to be well  rested  be able to appreciate their happy growg baby durg the day!
The Ezzo's make the case that nearly all of the babies followg their route sleep through the night at 3 months  some as early as 6 weeks  I don't doubt their claim-- is characteristic of all babies whether they  follow the Ezzo method  not I tried to follow the Ezzo route   was left utterly frustrated  despondent  Havg said that though   is only fair to pot out that one of the tras of good mothers is  their abily to be very well ganized  I agree  adherg to a  schedule but not as a means of controllg a baby's behavi rather to  make mother's le a ltle b easier
This book was given to me by a friend  of all the wonderful gts that first babies brg this was the best  I have tws  they were sleepg peacefully through the night by three  half months  They go to sleep   a timely manner whout much fuss  they wake up happy  Every parent  should read this book
The ideas  this book were scary!  I am so glad that after readg this book I read others  researched me! Numerous researchers have shown that the guideles set  this book concerng feedg guideles are not  only humane but can be dangerous  Many &quotfailure to thrive&quot  cases have been lked to the feedg schedules outled  this book   Many of the other premises set fth  this book also are potentially as  dangerous  Befe takg the fmation  this book as  &quotgospel&quot research all sources  check wh your pediatrion
I was lent this book (good because 's not wth the papaer 's wrten on All of these ideas are archaic (I'm amazed they didn't state that fmula is better than breastmilk) useless  mean spired A newbn's  sense of secury comes from knowg s parents WILL come when  cries   feed  when 's hungrynot from a schedule beg fced upon    s screams beg unanswered (at one pot they advise to let a baby cry  self to sleep'll last no longer than 45 mutes: Yeah after the  baby has made self sick  everyone has a splng headache!)To the  greatful couple that posted a posive review statg their baby slept  through the night at 8 weeks: that's relatively nmal  your baby might  be up all night tomarrow!I'm not a huge proponent of lettg a kid have  reign of the house but this book is just nasty If you're not prepared to  deal wh less sleep f awhile don't have a babyPS In his next book  will this sadist suggest that whippg the kid is an effective fm of  disciple?
I am the mother of two  expectg a third  Wh my first child I nursed on dem  didn't get me than 2 hours straigt sleep f 6 months  (I fally rested to breakg that hab  my heart by  lettg my baby cry himself back to sleep f about 4 nights  a row)  He  was thrivg  the 95th percentile f weight  Wh my second son I  followed the Baby Wise guideles (I came from a neighbhood of new moms  who swe by )  had a baby who slept through the night at 7 weeks I  never had to listen to him cry himself to sleep  just happened He was  also much me content durg daytime hours  He too was thrivg  gag a full pound his first week  four durg the first month   always  the 90th percentile range  I'll be usg the Baby Wise  guideles wh our third  I am surprised that some readers thk the  auths are tellg you to igne your child  I never got that from  readg this book  I understood them to say babies cry f dferent  reasons don't automatically assume 's hunger  don't respond wh a  bottle  breast  hunger isn't what's botherg them  They also wre of  babies need to play  f companionship  encourage you  other  family members to fulfill these needs  If you want a book that helps you  sleep through the night (which I believe is beneficial f baby  mom) by  establishg a rather flexible route then Baby Wise is f you  If  however you'd prefer to let your baby make all the dems  are okay  wh an erratic schedule ( all the moodess f baby mom  dad)  which can occur then maybe this book is not f you
I urge everyone to search the ternet f me fmation on Mr Ezzo  his credentials the background  histy of this book  the reaction of medical  child care professionals to   I've found  compellg cricisms published by Dr C Everett Koop  many other  proment docts across the country  Do your research first then decide
Just when  looked as though we might be gettg somewhere  Over the last twenty-odd years an undercurrent of parentg ideas  practices has begun to make s presence felt  the West I refer to among others  Contuum Concept Takg Children Seriously  much of what comes under  the umbrella of Attachment Parentg The practices have  common the  notion that young children  above all babies know better that any  parentg manual precisely what  is that they need  der to develop   the optimum fashion The idea is that by listeng (lerally   figuratively) to our children  also to our stcts while believg  as a guidg prciple that Nature really does know best we can allow our  children to achieve close to their potential fill of happess   well-adjustedness Thenalong comes a book like this one to return us to  the Dark Ages so to speak  Gary Ezzo's parentg techniques are not new   fact they are depressgly familiar It is a soulless simplistic  repressive approach to the awesome task of carg f babies  young  children which plays/preys on the understable desire of most new parents  to retroduce a ltle der ( sleep) to their lives  As f the  ideas themselves by  large they are opions  assertions backed up  by ltle  the way of evidence based on eher research   well-documented observation Full of half-truths  disgenuousness   Sadabove all f the defenceless victims of  &quotEzzoism&quot
In readg other reviews of this book I am not very suprised that the &quotpsychologists&quot are toutg the Ezzo's as abusive I read the first babywise book (I still refer to )  no where  the lerature  is there any ht of abuse I thk I have fally found out where the  selfish annoyg people are made They must reside  the homes of those  parents who let the kids run the show My husb  I are constantly  beg told what a happy giggly baby we have I have to believe that some  of that disposion comes from the route that he has been placed on He  slept through the night at 9 weeks He is 5 months old now but to the  naysayers dismay he is a strappg 20 lbs  28 ches! Please do not  let negative reviews of this book discourage you from at least readg what  the concepts volve As always use COMMON SENSE  decidg what will   will not wk f you  your family God will guide you  the proper way  to rear your child-whout this book He wrote His own you know
People terested  the common sense approach to parentg will love this book  The basic premise: You as a parent know how to meet your baby's needs best you dictate the schedules  Once you realize this prciple  takg care of your new creation becomes easyLike ALL parentg books on the market I have read  this one is also very opionated ( you do not do this then your child  will somehow not function  society)  As a discerng parent you have to  take all advise wh a gra of salt  apply what wks  does not  wk cludg me  As a foundation this plan wks our sany   nights of peace are proof
I highly recommend this book!  Befe readg  my baby was wakg up several times a night  not nappg durg the day  I was totally exhausted  at my ws end  This book changed all of that  At 7 weeks  of age my breastfed daughter was sleepg 6-8 hours a night  takg 3  naps a day  By 3 months she was sleepg 10-12 hours a night!   The  philosophies taught  this book really wk  completely changed our  le  My baby is very happy  well adjusted  This book will be my  stard gt f any future baby showers I attend
After readg this book I am a ltle concerned about s message I am wried that parents might bldly accept s &quotlessons&quot  neglect the needs of their children It is not easy wh such young babies  to terperet their cries to see  they are hungry cold  pa tired  wet  dirty Hunger is not the only reason they cryI thk this st of parentg approach is not really appropriate  f newbn babies I realise some people disagree but thk readers  should consider WHY they are tryg to make their baby sleep through Is   f the baby  perhaps a slighly me selfish reason
This is an excellent guide f mothers that need structure  their own lives  My greatest fear while I was pregnant was sleep deprivation  The basic prciple of this book feed your child on a schedule so they will  ganize their days  nights wked f us  Our ltle girl is breast  fed  growg  she slept through the night at 7 weeks  Like any  advice book use your bra to evaluate  adapt what wks f you as a  parent
I had been a successful breastfeedg mom f 10 months of a baby boy  I read Gary Ezzo's book  although there are pots I don't agree wh this book was an AWESOME base f settg up a good schedule  I weened my  son at one year  that is where I saw this book really wk  I am not  sure I could have done  while breastfeedg but I will try next timeI suggest readg this book  as wh any advice take  what you can to succeed  Good Luck
I would just like to say from a mother wh four kids under four years of age two boys  two girls I would be  a mental hospal from sleep deprivation  I had not followed these guideles!   To all the  reviewers of &quotfailure to thrive&quotcommentsAll of my children  have been above the 90th percentile  weight through the age of one   contue to thrive  I recommend this book to any person who wants their  children to not only be a joy to their own family but a joy to people  around them If you are willg to endure the first couple of weeks of  trag yourself to the needs of your child  recognizg the fact that  this is all common sense parentg that  the last generation we lost  this is f you You will be  control of how to recognize what your baby  needs  not drtg  the wd  not knowg what to do
My 12-month old daughter had very bad sleep habs (fostered by me nursg her at any cry)  I was tired  cranky so was she  This book was a great help  although I have read a few very negative reviews I saw  nothg  the book objectionable  The book recommends followg (  learng to follow) your baby's cues  There was some cryg f a few  nights but now a few weeks later we are all sleepg through the night   much happier  We are expectg another baby  I plan to use this  book as a reference
I heard about this book from a waress  a restaurant who said that her sister raved about the book's prciples of gettg baby to sleep through the night  As a parent of a 3-month old I was dyg to read Baby Wise   When I fally got a hold of a copy I found that I had been followg some  of the book's ideas already (through common sense) but the book suggested  some thgs that helped me better underst how to get my daughter on a  schedule  Most of all Baby Wise gave me peace of md that I was dog  somethg right  gave added advice on how to best take care of my baby's  eatg waketime  sleepg needs

This book gave me the confidence to help my son establish regular eatg sleepg  play times while also allowg me the flex-abily I needed to mata my 9 yr olds le  I put the recommendation  this book to  wk 7 days after we came home from the hospal  my son was sleepg  through the night by 10 weeks  Me imptantly his sleep/appete  patterns were well enough established that I could schedule appotments  run errs  leave him wh a friend whout the uncertaty of  &quotwhen will he be hungry/sleepy?  It also gave me the confidence to  teach him to put himself to sleep by layg him down awake somethg I  knew I should have done wh my first baby but never could believe   would wk  Copy the schedule f waketime acivies  fill one out  every day!  It helps to look back over the week  notice trends also  makes a good keepsake f fillg out baby's book later on!  (you won't  remember everythg!)
I got this book as a shower gt  only got through the 1st few chapters befe throwg  away  frustration  disgust  I could never let my baby cry due to hunger  not feed her  My pediatrician says that babies need to eat me often then every 4 hours durg the first few months to  grow properly It seems this advice is not only controversial  highly  opionated but dangerous The advice on co-sleepg really annoyed me  too  In most countries co-sleepgs is commonplace  we don't hear about  babies dyg Many parents have slept wh their babies whout cident   the advice this book gives is simply silly There are many benefs to  co-sleepg such as convenience  you're breastfeedg  creased  bondg wh your child  Don't waste your money on this book
I have just fished readg this book My first child is not due f another several months so I have no wkg knowledge of the method Like all the readg I have done so far I am takg the advice wh a gra of  salt However I am very surprised to read several reviews attackg the  book  the auth f thgs I feel the book does not advocate  the  first place Not once did I ever get the impression that the idea is to  igne your child! The idea is to EVALUATE the nature of the distress  befe automatically offerg the breast  the bottle Appropriate  response rather than automatic response is the idea As f Failure to  Thrive several several times the auth recommends checkg your baby's  growth  development agast the nm  proceedg accdgly F a  parent to do otherwise wh any method would be ignant  neglectful  I knew nothg of this method  the  auth befe someone gave me Baby Wise so I feel I can be fairly  objective  my statements here I had absolutely no preconcieved ideas   opions
I have one question f those of you who are agast the Babywise method Have you tried ?
I read these books after meetg children who were so happy  well-behaved that I felt compelled to ask the parents what their secret wasIt was this book series  I now have a 4 1/2 month old who has slept  thru the night sce she was 5 weeks old  This book emphasizes considerg  the context of each suation  flexibily versus followg strict  rules  The prciples of the series of books are guideles  My daycare  provider of 25 years experience says my daugher is a pleasure to watch   is a exceptionally happy  These books emphasise trag your child's  heart mally f future trsic motivation versus trsic motivation  They advocate strong marraiges playtime wh  affection to your child  repectg others (manners)  others' thgs  Somethg to consider   this time!  This book is just the begng prciples that are  age-appropriate After readg this first book my motherg became much  me enjoyable  It offers flexibily to our lives  It has decreased our  stress immeasurably (me husb's  baby's) because I rarely have to  guess at what she needs when she cries  She now wakes on her own  time  f feedgs whout cryg  I lay her down to sleep rarely wh a  fuss  When  is her bedtime she is like an alarm clock  gets a ltle  fussy a few mutes befe I lay her down she sleeps f 8-9 hrs a  night!   Good sleepg  eatg patterns are essential to brg out the  best  anyone - especially your precious baby!
I am a mother of 2 boys wh another boy on the way  a couple of months  This book  s philosophies is TREMENDOUS f mothers who enjoy sleepg after brgg a newbn to their homes  I used this program  wh both of my boys  they were sleepg through the night by the time  they were 6 weeks old  They are both extremley healthy  love le   each other!  I would HIGHLY recommend this book  It is only offensive to  the parents that cannot underst how their children may not be the center  of the universe  Parents that teach their children that they are the  center of the wld foster selfish children that grow to selfish adults  who cannot underst why the wld does not revolve around them  I know  this from experience  I used to be one such child This book is an  EXCELLENT source f parents who are ready to teach their children the  preciousness of others at a very early age  I LOVED   plan on usg   f all the children my husb  I may have
We used the babywise method f our daughter (now 2 1/2)   was very successful  She is happy healthy  slept through the night at 8 1/2 weeks  My recommendation to any parent is to use this method as a guide  You need to adjust the feedg schedule to your baby's needs  F example  my daughter generally ate every three hours but I had to adjust her  schedule when she was gog through growth spurts  At one pot she was  eatg every 15 hours because she was growg so much!If you follow the suggestion of the der of the schedule (  not the time table) you should be successful wh this method  Also I  had to adjust my baby's schedule about once a week as she grew dropped  feedgs etc  BE FLEXIBLE!
I was shocked when I clicked on the parents &amp family book section  saw that this was the book shown  the recommended column  First of all the by-le is misleadg  The book was wrten by Ezzo(the preacher)   ONLY THE PREFACE was wrten by Buckman the pediatricianAs a full-time mom  fmer  pediatric therapist I can't believe that igng a baby's cues now will  improve your relationship wh the child later   Wh so many good books  out there on fant care why waste your time  money on somethg so  potentially harmful?
My husb  I both loved this book!  It gave us a plan to go by when brgg home a newbn  Our baby slept through the night at 12 weeks this of course helped our marriage  my le as a new mom  Many of our  friends recommended Baby Wise  we all have healthy happy   well-rested babies who sleep through the night!  I have no idea what book  the negative reviewers are talkg about  As a college educated teacher I  took this wthy fmation  just like wh any advice/book I adapted  the parts that wked f my family  I  Our daughter has had wonderful  check-ups  our &quotschedule&quot has been suppted whole-heartedly  by our doct  My advice is: Don't knock  until you've tried 's  feedg about every 21/2 to 3 hours (the same advice I was given by the  nurses  the hospal)
As a board certied ternist  new mother I was very terested  gettg my full term baby to sleep through the night  Like any book you need to take away what is of value  I believe  the eat wake sleep  cycle but the 3-4 hour feedg cycles can be too sht f breast fed  babies Breast milk is digested me quickly than fmula  babies have  very small stomaches which may not ste enough nutrion to last f 3-4  hours My baby ate every 2-25 hours  nursed f 1-15 hours at a time   On this schedule he slept through the night begng at 5 weeks  I had  ially tried to lengthen his feedgs out to 3 hours as recommended by  Baby Wise but soon realized that he was hungry befe the 3 hour mark   Followg the 3-4 hour cycle recommendation can be dangerous to some  newbns  If your baby fs the 3-4 hours cycle great  If not follow  your parentg stcts  feed your baby  you thk he's hungry
I was absolutely appalled when I read this book the auths promote  my opion child abuse The only way I could possibly recommend this book to any parent would be  they WANTED to raise a child condioned to  accept abuse from any authy figure durg their letime Denyg a  small fant food  comft merely because an adult wants to sleep is  highly irresponsible
On April 20 2000 I submted a review  thought an update was  der  Wh a month after I discontued usg the Babywise method my baby slept 10 hours at night whout wakg  was takg consistent  naps  Contrary to what the book said he ganized his days  nights  when I just followed his lead  At night my baby goes to bed awake  whout rockg nursg  a pacier  puts himself to sleep   Sometimes he lies   his crib f thirty mutes smiles  coos at his  mobile  then does nothg me than whe f a few mutes befe  drtg off  This was all done whout igng my baby  lettg him  cry f extended periods of time  All that was necessary ially was  puttg him  his crib just befe he closed his eyes so that he put  himelf to sleep f the last few seconds  This gradually has extended to  mutes  I urge parents to just use their stcts  Babies can sleep  through the night relatively early whout employg the Babywise method
I hope anyone thkg of buyg this book will do someresearch first The American Academy of Pediatrics among many othershas come out wh serious warngs about this so-called methodF those whose ientation to this method is religious Christian pediatrician Dr William Sears has also issued a strong warng Please please please reconsider adoptg this dangerous plan
I started this from day one wh my daughter  She is now 8 months old  sleepg 12 hours a night  nappg well  She was exclusively breastfed until 4 months then solids added  We contue breastfeedg  She has  gaed weight steadily  healthily  She is a very happy  well loved  child  Everyone can do this She took a ltle longer to do the thgs the  book said she would but we stuck wh   she is now dog great!
What adult would want to live wh such a strict schedule?  Not me!  My  baby  I have a route but I couldn't see puttg her on such a  rigous schedule  She eats  sleeps when she wants to  is startg  to sleep thru the night on her own at 3 1/2 months WITHOUT makg her  &quotcry  out&quot  which I will NOT do This may have wked f  other Mom'sprobably wkg Mom's who don't have the abily to nap  durg the day to make up f sleepless nights but f stay at home Mom's  like me this doesn't make sense  Let your baby tell you what   needsfcg a schedule is unnatural  Try a book by Sammons &quotThe  self-Calmed Baby&quot  It is VERY sightful  useful whout the  strict schedule  But  does advocate the &quotcry  out&quot  technique  F an auth that does not advocate &quotcry  out&quot  try Dr William Sears
I knew long befe I had children that I wanted to nurse them The Babywise plan was recommended to me by a number of people The outcome was a desirable one but  seemed to recommend that women do the exact  oppose of what lactation consultants advise Could  wk wh  breastfeedg?You've  got to decide what is me imptant to you the best nourishment f yourchild  a peaceful night's sleep My vote was the best nourishment of my  child  I'll never regret 
This book is an excellent tool  The advice offered is not thebe all  end all  fant feedg but  is basically soundIf you apply the advice  the book  this way  give your baby lots of love hugs  affection you will probably fd that the plan has a lot of benefs
When my we  I had our first child the nurses docts  baby books all had dferent advice on how to take care of our newbn  Baby Wise had been highly recommended to us  I am so grateful to Ezzo f givg us a  guide to follow  Those of you who don't thk this book is great did not  read  all the way  It is not somethg you strictly follow but a guide  to help you make decisions to soothe your baby  help them develop  healthy sleep patterns  By the way most people go 6  7 hours whout  food -WHEN THEY SLEEP!  Our baby sleeps through the night  wakes up wh  a smile on his face  Those of you who want to spoil your children by  stuffg food down their mouths everytime they cry - get a le!  Baby Wise  does not tell you to let your child cry f any longer than 15 mutes  It  also says  they do go comft them That maybe all they need is some time   Mommy's arms I love my baby  I am convced that this guide has  helped me know what to expect  how to hle suations  a manner that  helps my baby learn disaple  be a happy healthy child
My daughter (my first-bn) was breast-fed on dem  didn't sleep through the night until she was a year  a half!  I applied the prciples  this book wh my two sons who are 15 months apart  they  were both sleepg through the night befe 10 weeks  I found the  predictabily liberatg  I was able to me readily discern the meang  of my sons' cries  respond to them accdgly  I was very surprised  to see so many negative reviews  Every mom I personally know (6 of my  close friends  family)who has used the Babywise plan has been thrilled  wh the results  the dads are all f  too!  The book DOES allow  some flexibily contrary to what some reviews suggest  It's not a rigid  system of neglectg your child  It's a plan to encourage healthy sleep   eatg patterns   wked wonders f me!  I would recommend this  book  other materials wrten by the Ezzos to anyone wh enough sense  NOT to be legalistic  sensive to the needs of their child
A woman I know received this book as a gt Two weeks after her baby was bn she &amp her husb began applyg the Ezzo prciples because they were &quotdesperate f a good night's sleep&quot They effectively  taught their son that  he cried they would not respond so he stopped  cryg f any reason His weight started to plummet sce he never  &quotasked&quot f food  he became que lethargic As an  experienced mother this woman thought she had a &quotgood&quot baby  because he was so cooperative -- usg defions from the Ezzo book   Luckily the pediatrician realized what was happeng befe the child had  to be hospalized  The child is now 5  has various emotional   developmental problems that the docts say are a direct result of neglect   his early months These are not bad people -- they were just very  experienced parents who put all their trust  the Ezzo philosophy  stead of followg their stctsI have sce read the book  I  thk that s blanket statements are very easy f an experienced parent  to misunderst This is a dangerous book f new parents  I would not  recommend  at all
I want to bust the myth that the Babywise &quotmethod&quot has ANYTHING to do wh when babies beg to sleep through the night!   Babies' sleep patterns naturally beg to regulate at around 8 weeks as their stomachs  grow  they are able to eat me  a feedg keepg their appetes  sated  Babywise explos this developmental fact  convces people that  s &quotmethods&quot are responsible f babies' sleep when  realy  around 8 weeks is when babies have matured enough to beg sleepg f  periods longer than 2 hours at a stretch     My father is a  pediatrician  my brother is a family doct  they agree that the  Babywise method is wrong  that beg a responsive parent is right  My  thrivg &amp happy  2 month old bears this out  She began sleepg 7  hours a night at 7 weeks  at 10 weeks now sleeps 8-10 hours a night   She is a product of attachment parentg (no co-sleepg) Dr Sears' The  Baby Book  my stctive RESPONSES to her cries  To igne an  fant's cries is cruel  human  to thk that igng them will  help the baby to &quotsleep&quot is downright illogical
The Babywise book is very damagg advice that is denounced by pediatricians the American Academy of Pediatrics  even the church  which Ezzo launched this program Parentg is a nighttime responsibily  not an 8-5 job the thgs Ezzo advocates are not  the best terest of  the child I hope anyone readg Ezzo's advice weighs  agast the  creria of whether the advice is  the terest of the child  Ezzo is  actually under vestigation f causg failure to thrive  even death  Babies need lots of hugs  touchg Ezzo advocates lettg them lay   the cribs  cry A study on monkeys was done years ago  which the baby  monkeys were not hugged  held They all died Failure to thrive is a  medical term  unftunately  happens daily especially  babies whose  parents follow Ezzo's teachgs This is not an opion  is a reference  to a news article highlightg medical concerns lkg Ezzo to FTTI actually actively campaign my local bookstes to  become aware of his dangers  der documentation of cricism   warngs that I give them There's a doct  Calnia who is so  concerned f the welfare of these babies that he sends a free packet  / PDF file to anyone emailg him (aneybody@aolcom)
I'm frightened at the thought that this book contues to be on bestseller lists I received this book f a baby shower  was at first thrilled by the prospect of gettg our baby to sleep through the night It made some  sense  I thought I would apply the prciples  a loose way --  discountg the they that newbns need time alone f example In  sht the methods made me miserable made my baby hungry (she took 3 weeks  to rega birth weight)  eventually led to the demise of my milk supply  I also underst that the Ezzos clude spankg from the age of as early  as 5 months as part of their they All  all I thk this method  teaches parents to distance themselves from their children  igne their  own stcts Try The Baby Book by William Sears stead
After 6 weeks wh ltle sleep f eher parent  newbn a friend recommend the Ezzo's materials  It was the best thg that ever happened to us!  Our child was sleepg through the night  3 days  adapted to  the swch easily  The mere presence of a route has kept behavial  problems to a mimum I realize children are all dividuals  maybe  we're just lucky but others that teract wh our son can not believe how  well behaved he is! My sister can't believe the dference eher  has  even gone to the extent of startg the Babywise/Childwise prciples wh  her toddler I am a teacher myself logic lends self to Ezzo's pricpals  on establishg secury by establishg route  still providg  flexibily There's many cricisms to his teachgs but after much  research I believe many parents haven't truly &quotunderstood&quot the  method  have fgotten the ultimate truth that we still need to  &quotparent&quot the child  Ezzo's prcipals on marriage  strength   old fashioned parentg are just what we need  todays declg mal  society!  Our toddler is thrivg  we've followed all  Babywise/Childwise materials throughout his growth!  And will contue to  do so!
This book makes me ill I can't believe that anybody would let their child &quotCry  out&quot when they come home from the hospal  What ever happened to the they that you cannot spoil a child until they are around  6 months of age? I was disgusted that there are so many mothers  fathers  that use this approach  It is like a boot camp f the newbn  I have  decided to agast all of these prciples  I nurse my baby befe he goes  to sleep I play wh him after he gets up   he wakes up durg the  night I go  check  he has wet himself  is too cold  Usually my  motherly stct is right  This book does not leave room f  dividualy  puts all babies to a mold No thank you- I want to  enjoy my baby while he is baby  fulfill his needs  be a carg   lovg mother not a sergeant
My son was a patient of (co-auth) Dr Bucknam's when he was bn (1994) I was given the earlier version of 'Babywise' by Dr Bucknam while I was  the hospal I read the book  followed the suggestions to the letter  as a result  I discontued breastfeedg my son when he was 6 weeks old  At his two-week checkup he still hadn't re-gaed his birthweight which  should have been my first clue that somethg was amiss
This book gave me an unsettlg feelg when I read   was  conflict wh Sears &quotThe Baby Book&quot (which wasreccommended by my pediatrician) on all issues I decided to get someunbiased opionions  Read the very fmed article   discover that the auth is a evangelical Christian mister not a doct  A baby whdraws  gives up when his crys are igned  there is alarmg evidence of medical danger wh this program Read the article yourself be fmed I wasted a Saturday readg  don't bother
I would like to start by sayg that I have read both this book  s predecess Preparation f Parenthood which is the Christian version  was NOT wrten wh a doct They are almost identicalIf you are lookg f a  parentg manual that takes a me balanced  medically fmed  approach I recommend The Complete Book of Christian Parentg   Childcare by William Sears MD  his we Martha Sears RN who have  8 kids themselves
Across the uned states pediatricianslactation consultants respected Christian leaders are expressg their concerns about the parentg program  offered  babywise In 1996 the Orange county Child abuse prevention council of ange county ivestigated this program  response to the  medical communy's growg concern related to fants seen wh  dehydrationslow growth  developmentas well as failure to thrive  The   parents of these babies were followg the parentg style taught  this  book The American Academy of Pediatrics contues to  reaffirm s stance  that the best feedg schedules are ones babies design themselves  A  lovg alternative to &quotbabywise&quot is the attatchment style of  parentg you can learn about  The Baby Book by William Sears
We used the prciples taught  this book wh our first child  were very pleased wh the results Our son is happy healthy  well behaved The people who have babysat him all agree Those who were skeptical about  the schedulg (an aunt  a gr-mother) changed their mds after  babystg him  want their other gr-children to be given the same  good care It's not about makg our lives easier as some suggest  their  reviews It's about a willgness to teach your children some values rather  than leavg them on their own Look around they won't learn  on their  own  no-one will teach them f you This book will give you a very  practical hs-on set of guideles not just book knowledge My sister  used these prciples wh her children several of our friends did as  well The response is consistent Notice that those who give this book a  bad review  general didn't use  We're expectg our second child   will be reviewg the Ezzos teachgs
After 4 weeks of endless sleep wh my first child my friend gave me this book to read  It was perfect  By six weeks she was sleepg through the night!  I have read many thgs on this subject cludg dehydration   failure to thrive  Well I am not sure where they are gettg their  fmation but my daughter thrived wonderfully  dehydration was never  a problem  Also schedules are so imptant f children  As parents we  need to set the boundaries  direct them crectly  I don't believe   lettg my children run my le f me  My daughter is happy  has a  wonderful disposion  She is the love of my le  she knows that  Now  that I have another baby (now 2 months old) I have put him on the same  schedule as I did wh my daughter  he is dog spectacular  I really  disappoted by the narrow mded people that don't want to give their  children a chance by directg them stead of the children directg the  parents!
This book should be a best seller  My husb  I read  followed this book closely wh our first baby  he is extremely happy  healthy  Everyone who meets him can't believe how happy he is  what a  great dispostion he has!  A number of co-wkers  friends have also  followed the babywise pricals wh similar sterlg results!  Thank you  Mr Ezzo!
Although you'd hardly know  from readg the reviews  thebook self Babywise remas very controversial It is imptant that you underst the context  which this book  was wrten The premise  arguments are very seductive  they can even convce you that you are remiss as a parent  you don't implement the Babywise \\"fant management system\\" They are  fact mostly the parentg philosophies  the auth   the science ced to suppt many of his claims has been called to  question  Do your baby a fav  get the facts behd this book befe  you give  to 's promise
Befe I read this book my son was sleepg  2 to 3 hour blocks at night  durg the day  seemed he was eatg all day long I started Baby Wise  wh 2 days he was sleepg me  was on a daily  schedule f the first time sce comg home from the hospal He was  happier  so was I Now about 3 1/2 wks later he is sleepg through the  night (about 8 hours) eatg well  very happy--so are we! Le has  some ganization to   we are not sleep deprived zombies anyme He  is me playful  we are enjoyg parenthood a lot me As f the  concerns that this approach will reduce weight ga--not so My son has put  on almost 10 lbs sce birth  the doct is extremely pleased wh his  growth Some also thk that you have to let them cry but my child has not  had to at all Sometimes I let him fuss a ltle which my doct told me I  could do from the start--but he has never &quotcried  out&quot We know  several parents who tried this   has wked f all of them Hope   wks f you too!
This book should be a best seller  My husb  I read  followed this book closely wh our first baby  he is extremely happy  healthy  Everyone who meets him can't believe how happy he is  what a  great dispostion he has!  A number of co-wkers  friends have also  followed the babywise pricals wh similar sterlg results!  Thank you  Mr Ezzo!
My husb  I read Babywise  followed most of the &quotrules&quot  As predicted our daughter began sleepg through the night at 8 weeks  Havg said that I would warn parents that the ten  tone of this book   s sequel are a b hard to swallow  As a new mother I found the  &quotvoice&quot of the book to be misogynistic -  thgs don't wk  out 's Mom's fault  My husb felt the book gave ltle advice on how  he could play an active role  our daughter's le other than to hold  thgs together  I variably broke down This book was of no help  whatsoever  transiong from the home to daycare  Clearly the auths  do not approve of mothers who wk outside the home  Fally we  completely igned the rules about cryg -  my daughter cried  I gave  her comft  held her as long as she needed  she still learned to  fall asleep on her own
This book is THE book f parents who want happysecure well fed  well rested children that are a joy to be around f both the parents  others My child is now 10 months old He is breastfed  the route  described  Babywise has allowed me to contue despe my return to wk  when he was 3 months I began usg the sleepg prciples when he was 5  weeks old  wh 3 days he was sleepg comftably through the night  Now he loves his bed  bedtimes are NEVER a problem  I was afraid to  allow him to cry at first but when I did he cried only 8 mutes the first  time--- po baby was so sleep deprived because I was tryg so many  attachment parentg priciples that he was fussy all the time  never  gettg really good sleep  The hardest thg was allowg cryg but I  scerely feel that  is a very natural part of parentg  the book  clearly explas when to respond to a cry  when  may be best not to  This book explas  detail how to establish sleepg  feedg routes  that teach good habs f a letime
This book is the best book f survivg the newbn months that I have ever found  Fally a book that says 's OK f the PARENT be  charge stead of the child Our baby at 8 weeks old was wakg up every hour to  hour  a half  Both my husb  I were exhausted   desperation  he picked up this book  I read  at 11am  the mng  that night  our child only woke up twice a welcome swch from 4  5 times!  My  mother  law asked why our baby doesn't ever cry like his cous  I  explaed that he knows his needs will be met on a regular basis  he  doesn't need to cry to get fed changed  napped  If you follow this  book your child will be happier sleep better  cry less ( you will  sleep better  cry less too!)
When I was pregnant several of my friends recommended this book  They said their children responded beautully to   were sleepg through the night relatively early  Naturally I was trigued  I bought the book  - the whole series actually -  read  carefully  Twice  The concept  sounded great  Too bad not all babies are alikeI would urge parents who are terested  this method  to watch their babies  I believe there would have been signicant health  consequences f my baby had I not aboned the program  F example he  had been havg regular bowel movements but durg the time period I  employed the Babywise plan he stopped havg regular bowel movementsOnce I aboned  he was back to nmal  It probably had somethg to  do wh the fact that he was not eatg well  If parents are willg to  try this plan then I wish them luck but not to the detriment of their  babies health
I purchased this book after readg all of the posted reviews My son was five weeks old  I was tired  needed some guidence We followed the basic guidles laid out  the book  my son slept through the night by  the time he was ne weeks old We never just let him cry as some of these  other reviews seem to suggest Addionally the book advises parents to  use their best judgement This is a book that allows you to put your child  on an easy schedule that bens the child  the family
This book is a God send! I wish I had known about  wh my first child I have a 2 1/2 year old  a 9 week old A friend loaned me this book she's not gettg  back when my 9 week old was 6 weeks After I read the book I immediately started the route My baby responded posively to   right away The second night she dropped her middle of the night feedg  permanently She is a very happy  content baby smilg  coog  constanly  After dem feedg my first child never knowg why she was  cryg  beg very stressed out I feel the weight of the wld has  been lted from my shoulders  The advice  this book is so enlighteng  Especially after only hearg the cliches &quotYou can't hold your baby to  much&quot  &quotYou can't love your baby too much&quot  Wh my  first child I read lots of parentg magazes  parentg books that all  eluded to the same cliches I was searchg f another way because I was a  basket case just ask my husb Dferent people I know kept tellg me  to just let my baby cry a ltle but they offered no good reasong   that was not good enough f me I wanted to &quotdo  right&quot   the only advice I could fd was the current thkg This book has given  the histy of where these current beliefs  cliches have come from   why These auths have given sound  common sense reasong behd their  advice  I could identy wh almost everythg  their book regardg  child centered parentg because I lived  wh my first child There is a  better way! My whole family is happier  much me stable because of the  advice  this book I call this a best kept secret because I never would  have found  on my own
This book is the BEST one on sleep  eatg cycles It stresses that PARENTS know what is best f their babies While other moms are still gettg up 2  3 times a night at 6  8 months wh the help of this  book both my children were sleepg 8-10 hours at night by 6 weeks old  Both were on breast milk  because of the 3 hour schedule my supply was  strong When I was listeng to the La Leche League women my supply was  dimishg because of the too frequent feedgs Wh Babywise that all  went away We have happy healthy well rested children  you can too  Please give this book a try
This book has really great guideles f new mothers who have no idea what their child is suppose to be dog  Once I read this book I had peace when dealg wh my baby because I knew what I was dog  I wasn't totally strict wh my baby's schedule but most of the time  naturally  led up wh what this book is talkg about  It is defely wth the  purchase!
When I was pregnant we focused so much on the pregnancy that  didn't occur to us to decide what kd of parentg philosophy to adpot  This book helped us to defe  refe the kd of parents we wanted to be  ONE of the benets of this book is sleepg through the night (f you AND  baby) but  is much me than that  This book helps you keep a clear  head about parentg  what is really best f your child  It will even  help you  the first stages of disciple  If you like this book look  f the follow-up books f older children  I now give this as a  &quotpregnancy gt&quot to all my girlfriends
This book was a great help to my husb  I The most useful fmation   was that babies enter light sleep first then deep sleep This explaed why my 3 week old was exhausted he was capnappg all day -  light sleep only - because I was carryg him around wh me everywhere  Wh a day of begng Babywise his fussg was cut  half No wonder  he was rested While I wouldn't say we've followed everythg  the book  to the letter  does wk I fail to underst the controversy  surroundg the advice given  this book I thk most of the people  complag of these methods have never tried them they are envisiong a  screamg baby alone  a crib My 9 week old son does occasionaly fuss  when I put him  his crib to sleep Usually 's because he's had an  especially active  stimulatg &quotup time&quot  is a ltle  overtired from  I would never dream of lettg him lie  his crib  screamg himself to sleep That's not what the book recommends Instead  he may wail a few times  then go to sleep on his own Fally a note  to the reviewer who mentioned that several parents have sued the auths  as proof that the book is an example of thly disguised child abuse I'm a  lawyer  believe me that means NOTHING Do you really thk that the  fact a lawsu is filed means that the complat is based  realy? Take  a good look at the wld around you - only a platf's attney would  have you believe that is the case
I went on le to der BabyWise II because my husb  I were so pleased wh the first book  I was shocked to see that some people feel this method is cruel!  When the auth's guideles are used sensibly  nothg could be further from the truth  The first two months of my son's  le I fed my son at the slightest whimper whout stoppg to evaluate  whether he was hungry tired lonely bed etc  I rocked him to sleep f  2 hours every night  was up at least twice to feed him  we were all  generally exhausted  miserable  Babywise helped us develop a FLEXIBLE  route that brought der to our lives  sured that our son had  regular good feedgs had &quotplaytime&quot when he got non-feedg  attention  sured that we all got enough rest  The book advocates  evaluatg  mong your child's need   no way advocates  neglect!  Did we follow every sgle recommendation of the book to the  letter?  Of course not we used our own good judgment  common sense   adapted the method f our child's needs  While this method may not be f  everyone the book's prciples can help give you  your child the  secury  predictabily of a route  I would recommend readg    tryg  out f yourself  I agree wh another reader who said  &quotthe proof is  the puddg&quot - we have a happy thrivg 9  month old who is off the growth charts sleeps all night naps twice a day   is a joy to be around
This book is a must f any parent that has a coliky baby  I was at my ws end befe I got the book  the docts were no help  givg me suggestions on what to do f my daugher's colic  As soon as I received  the book I started readg   followg the auths' advice The book  states &quotIf you baby does suffer from colic the best thg you can do  is to keep that child on a route  This allows his  her stomach to rest  between feedgs&quot  That was the key to makg my daughter happier
I am a registered nurse certied childbirth  educat certied lactation consultant  most imptantly a MOTHER I have used this book  recommend  to many parents I give  as a baby shower gt  The  prciple of scheduled feedgs every 2-4 hours dependg on fants age   needs regulates  stabilizes blood sugars thereby decreasg  irrabily  fussess  fants Regular scheduled feedgs sure  agast dehydration  malnutrion as opposed to irregulary of dem  feedg All babies  the NICU are placed on strict feedg schedules how  can this be good f them   is supposedly dangerous f a healthy  full-term newbn?  The AAP f hundreds of years recommended feedg  schedules f fants  now they want you to thk s dangerous There  is nothg rigid  strict  a feedg schedule unless you make  that  way  This book teaches parents to nurture  love their children  to  respond to their needs/cries appropriately stead of givg the  bottle/breast  pacier immediately It teaches parents to be me   tune wh their babies dividual needs  It teaches new parents to trust  themselves  that they do know what is best f their child  This type of  parentg is not f everyone  Some people can not f schedules to  their busy lestyles that's ok  Many will fd this parentg style a  great blessg
This book is extremely valuable  learng how to know what your baby needs  when  It is by far the best fmation on how to tra your child to sleep through the night  Some people argue that  is too rigid   strict  I fd these people are not truly readg the  &quotguideles&quot Gary Ezzo presents but rather are legalistic   their approach to this method  Gary Ezzo advocates usg your &quotcommon  sense&quot  not be so rigid that you follow the schedule to the mute!   This method offers a lot of freedom to &quotschedulg&quot your child   encourages you to use your common sense!  I would not however  recommend this f a parent who cannot follow a schedule  has to be  &quoton the run&quot all the time  a parent who is not a &quotstay at  home parent&quot  These parents will not succeed wh the method   unftunately will achieve their goal  have a cranky unhappy child!
Top pediatricians  leadg children's magazes have come out strongly agast this book  the Babywise system has sent several babies to the hospal  Some of the messages  beliefs are appealg  the schedules themselves seem fe  Havg a parent centered household is a  value I share  gettg my kids on schedules was very helpful f all of  us  Followg this method strictly can be a dangerous way to achieve those  goals though so please  consult your pediatrician befe rigidly applyg  this system  If you read this book please discuss   wh your pediatrician befe applyg the methods strictly  Wkg  towards a schedule can be very helpful f the whole family  But always  apply your common sense  listen closely to your baby
I have read  reread this book several times  And  does have some good advice but  practice f some babies  stops sht child abuse  Not all babies are alike me sensive  tempermental babies should NOT  be fced onto this program!  I put my 7 week old on this program f 24  hours I followed  to the letter  It resulted  a baby that ate half of  her nmal take  a baby that was so traumatized that she became jumpy   frightened at the slightest of sounds made  Be an fmed parent!  If  you have any reservations about this program DO NOT use !  F those  that have highly sensive babies I recommend that you read  use the  techniques  &quotHealthy Sleep Habs Happy Child&quot by Marc  Weisbluth MD  The methods taught  this book allow the child to set 's  own schedule naturally rather than fce one on him  her  And the  transion is much easier on both the baby  the parent!
This is the best book about babies that I have ever read  gives practical ideas about your baby's feedg playg  sleepg based on a parent centred rather than child centred approach  My first baby was  sleepg through the night (wh no night feeds!)at fourteen weeks  my  second at two weeks  If sleep is a priy then BUY THIS BOOK!
Apparently some of the others who have not rated this book well have not actually read   s entirety!  This was the most wonderful tool I had as a new mother  now beg pregnant wh my second I will use  aga   It  no way &quotstarves&quot your child on the contrary!  It puts your  fant on a feedg schedulehow smart!  Talk about keepg your baby's  metabolism on track! And as f sleephellobabies are supposed to  sleep alot!  My son was sleepg through the night at 5 1/2 weeks - 8  hoursby 8 weeks he was sleepg 11-12 hoursthis is what you want  your baby to do!  I encourage every new mother AND father to read this   use !
Babywise has helped my baby be a happier me content baby  Babies need consistency as any parent knows  the routes suggested  Babywise  provide that consistency  My baby is drkg as much as the AAP  recommends f her weight  height  has been on a 4-feedgs/day  schedule sce just less than 3 months old  She only dehydrates when she  is sick  at that time we alter her route to make sure she is gettg  enough nutrients  liquids to get through the stuffy nose that makes  nursg so dficult  I especially approved of Babywise's focus on  nursg  It is true that your baby can be sleepg through the night by 10  weeks even on breast-milk!  The new revised version of this book is very  though  explag exactly what thgs you must be firm on  what  thgs can vary a ltle  Overall the only thg I found hard to get  through was the great amount of philosophy  the chapters  But even  though I didn't agree wh every sgle thg  the book I found the ma  idea to be of great wth  Most imptantly that the auths urge the  reader to get to know their baby (as each baby is unique): know their cries   what they need at a given suation  When your baby is on a schedule  you are able to know why they are cryg at a given time because you know  when  is time to eat when they are most likely tired  when they are  cryg out of the dary f reasons such as sickness  teethg  I  would urge anyone who cares about the well-beg of their baby as well as  their own needs to buy this book study   apply 
I wish we would've read this book sooner when we had our first son  He was a &quotsnacker&quot  wasn't latchg on well but we hadn't heard this from anyone befe - not docts nurses  even some of the so-called  lactation experts  the area  The nurses  the hospal were absolutely  useless  fact  Our daughter is now 13 days old gag weight  beautully sleeps a 5-6 hour stretch durg the night already (  DOESN'T wake up cryg)  My mom has been a nurse f 35 years but  couldn't really provide any help  advice sce she didn't breast-feed any  of my brothers  sisters  Whether you breast  bottle feed the  fmation presented  this book seems well explaed  backed by the  experience of many parents
The goal of Babywise is to fce to beg children who are outwardly compliant sleep a lot  don't terfere wh their parents' lives rather than teachg parents how to develop happy healthy contented  telligent babies Who  their right md wouldn't want a happy healthy  contented telligent baby  child?
I totally agree wh the nurse  the others who were disturbed by this book  I too am a nurse wh several years of pediatric experience  I currently wk  a program that helps first-time-mothers learn parentg  skills which cludes bondg wh  &quotlisteng to&quot their  babies  This book completely goes agast everythg we have learned   everythg we teach  If you read this book please keep an open md!   Remember newbns cannot go f long periods whout eatg  Their blood  sugar can drop  they may become unable to awaken  Please use  caution!
I am a nurse wh years of experience wh babies toddlers  small children I have heard  helped wh me sleep issues then you will ever dare to image I will say I have recommended many methods f many  dferent parents  children Some respond better to some thgs   others to somethg totally dferent I love parentg/sleep books by  William Sears as well as believg that Ferber wks better f other  families But this book shocked  saddened me This whole parentg  philosophy just hries me! Babies on a feedg schedule? The AAP  (American Academy of Pediatrics) CLEARLY recommends agast this Babies  need to be dem fed  while endurg illness growth spurts stress  etc may NEED to be fed every 2 hours I cannot underst where the Ezzos  (NOT docts) get their feedg  medical advice The ONLY pediatrician  to advise on this book was a young man wh NO children himself just  startg out! I agree not all parents will be comftable wh sleep  sharg slg wearg etc I wasn't BUT let my newbn/baby cry? Tra  her? My child is a person a human I would not do thos to my PETS let  alone my children Parents read this book get a false sense of secury  They wonder why their child is not follwog this book why their child is  still screamg why their child is losg weight dehydrated become  whdrawn etc As a nurse I HIGHLY recommend agast this book Not only  has  led many babies  the hospal 's brought feelgs of guilt  failure stress  sadness to many Not all babies are alike Parents need  to tail an approach f them  their child You cannot tra a child  you can teach  help them This book says  recommends thgs my  Grmother a proper English mom of 13 was saddened by None of the  pediatricians I know recommend this book  all caution agast  I'd  sterr clear of 2 overly preachy parents tryg to make a dollar at the risk  of your child/baby I'd recommend readg books by William Sears Penelope  Leach Ferber  others to gather some ideas  sleep methodsthen  follow what wks best f you  your child However the ideas  this  book are nothg sht of dangerous  should not be used
We have so far raised three fants usg me  less the feedg  sleep schedulg methods described  this book We have found  to be valuable You will read many reviews on this web se that sist that this book is a hbook f neglect  child abuse but this is patently  absurd Most of these people simply have a philosophical opposion to  schedulg  prefer to feed their children whenever they cry This of  course assumes that children nearly always are cryg because they are  hungry  that they are always hungry when they are eatg Neher of  these assumptions is true Our experience has been that &quotdem  fed&quot babies will &quotsnack&quot off  on all day  often all  night Scheduled babies on the other h will eat fully at their  scheduled times  not be hungry  the tervals This book advocates a  very reasonable common sense approach to schedulg  doesn't encourage  anyone to become a slave to a schedule Schedules can  should be altered  at times to meet the specic needs of the baby  every baby is of  course unique
Although several pots were terestg  this book on the whole I found many pots cruel  disturbg  First a baby should not be sleepg through the night at seven weeks  A child still needs nourishment every two to three hours at that age  The American Academy of Pediatrics  suggests that a baby should sleep through the night at three to four months   the child will do  naturally NOT because you allowed them to scream  themselves to exhaustion  If you don't want to be awaken  the middle  of the night do not have a baby  Also the schedules are too rigid   don't allow f alterations  Use your best judgement  consult wh your  baby's doct Skip over this book entirely
What new parent doesn't want their child to sleep through the night? But the methods presented  this book are based on the auths knowledge of Christiany  &quotGod's way&quot stead of upon sound parentg experience/knowledge After readg the entire book I am me convced  than ever that placg a newbn baby on a strict schedule is not the  answer PLEASE read parentg books by experts  the field  leave this  volume on the shelves!
This book is full of dangerous mis-fmation Ezzo is afundamentalist mister--NOT a parentg expert  REAL experts likeDr Berry Brazelton Penelope Leach Dr William Sears  Jeanne Elium have all expressed distaste wh Ezzo's methods Buy their books NOT this one!
This book has been the most useful productive book I have ever read!  Our child is happy  sleepg just as they said he would be  Now we put him down  he knows 's time to sleep  Everyone I've spoken to that has  used this book has had success  I was convced to go wh  after our  friends recommended   the person at the bookste counter said she  has only heard rave reviews from her customers  I now recommend  to all  of my friends as they have their own children  Get this book as early as  possible  read  wh your spouse  You'll be nothg sht of thankful  to the auths
I don't to wre a big review statg what others have already said so I'll just say that those who are  fav of this book are exactly right  Both my kids slept through the night by 7 weeks  they never went hungry   The doct that my firstbn was seeg didn't like that I followed a  schedule  predicted that my child would be underweight  Well she was   f que a suprise when my baby exceeded her birthwieght at 1 week of  age  I like structure  followed a schedule from day one  Some people  don't like schedules  the auth pots out that this is not meant to be  legalistic  It is a route  all that means is that there is a repeated  pattern  You don't HAVE to do everythg at the exact same time every day   In fact they mention that  you have no flexibily  your baby's  route you are not usg the plan crectly because you are probably  igng your baby  Anyway I love Babywise  I recommend  to everyone  I know  I have very happy kids  They are well fed obedient  pleasant   And as the others who suppt this book have said-  you read   try    you don't like don't do 
I have to laugh as I read the reviews on this book  Most of the negative reviews seem to come from folks who eher have limed readg comprehension  simply don't read the book at all  There are just as  many pediatricians family practice docts parents  other  &quotprofessionals&quot that attest to the reasonableness of Ezzo's book  as there are who disclaim s mer
I thk that this book holds some good guideles  Children do need some st of structure  HOWEVER let me say that I tried the prciples  the book wh my fant  he was a miserable hungry tired ltle baby  He  really did need to breastfeed me than the book would 'allow'  I don't  fd the fmation milaristic after all you could take the advice   leave  noone is MAKING you follow the book wd f wd  However as  a new mother who hasn't been exposed to children befeh the book did  make me start thkg along the les of schedules  route  I just  took  as a guide of sts not as a strict regime  I've heard from  friends who had babies that responded well to the program  apparently  f some kids  really does wk  wks well enough that the book was  recommended to me by several peopleAs a side note I read somewhere  that the reason why the book now cludes warngs about dehydration is  that the earlier edions didn't clude them  babies were wdg up   the hospal due to dehydration  parents were sug Ezzo
I totally disagree wh any reviewers that found the auth's theies to be milant  parent-selfish  The explanations of the feed-wake-sleep cycle were valuable to underst the needs of a baby  My baby was bn  13 weeks early  I didn't even beg to &quotuse&quot this book until he  was 21 weeks old (already 7 weeks &quotcrected&quot age)  He took  immediately to the play  nap routes  He was happier knowg he was  gog to have a nap when he was tired  he always woke up happy  He was  never &quotalone  neglected&quot  his room as other reviewers have  wrten  Perhaps they misterpreted this book  Of course he spends time  alone  his room when nappg  durg quiet playtime  Parents who thk  that their babies need parental attention 24 hours a day are not readg  properly their babies'signals  Even babies need &quotalone&quot time   My baby never cried when put down f a nap  never woke up cryg   When he grew hungry I fed him even  was &quotearly&quot but the  pot of the book's they is that f the most part your baby will be  hungry at roughly the same times so that both the parent  the baby know  what the baby wants  when  It is better than parents who feed a baby  every time  cries whether  not 's hungry merely because they don't  know what else to do  My baby is always happy I comft him when he needs  me  he knows how to comft himself  I love him wh everythg that I  am  I thk parents need to thk f themselves  not blame their  babies' dehydration etc on a book
I have used this books prciples from the begng   has wked great My 6-month old sleeps through the night takes naps great  is a happy healthy baby She started sleepg 5-6 hours by 8-9 weeks As wh  all advice style books you just have to use common sense A rigid schedule  is not good f anyone but a flexible schedule can save your sany! I  recommend this book to all my friends who are havg kids
I am shocked  dismayed as I read the negative reveiws of this book  It is every parents responsibily to take  fmation observe their child  decide what is best f their child  This philosophy of parentg is  not designed to be milaristic but  is designed to be structured  If  you are not a structured person then do not use this method  If you are   you value sleep then give  a try  If your child doesn't take to   then stop!   The auths are very clear to outle the danger signs of a  baby who is eher dehydrated  not growg properly You should be  observant  make sure that your child is not sufferg from those  symptoms  The auths also make  very clear that this is a process    your child is clearly hungry (even   is early) then FEED HIM I  thk any lawsus that have been brought agast the auths can be  classied as frivolous  Ultimately parents are responsible f their  children's well beg not the auth of a parentg advice book   If you  are terested  schedulg your child's feedgs then read the book   decide f yourself  Gary Ezzo is not God n does he claim to be  Use  good sense observe your child closely  make the best decision f your  family  I have a six month old   wked f a charm f us  She was  sleepg through the night at 4 weeks  However we never deprived her of  food  she was hungry but wh a schedule  was easier to deduce what  the problem was when she cried  It wked f her we will try  aga    doesn't wk f our next child then we won't use   Please take  responsibily f your own family  This book is merely advice  I  thk the majy of  is good advice
I found the recommendations  Baby Wise to be que helpful  However my 2 breastfed children responded dferently  I learned about the book when my first baby was 5 weeks old She was a pretty good night sleeper (6  hours) but had dficulty wh naps  At 7 weeks I tried    took 3  DAYS f her to establish the eat-wake-sleep route  What a dference  that made  our days!  Now at 18 months she naps twice f about 90  mutes each durg the day  sleeps 12 hours at night  Wh that  success I decided to try  wh my son right from the start  He was a  dferent baby of course  I was very unsuccessful at the begng So  I gave up temparily When he was 5 weeks old I tried the route aga  It took him about 10 days to really get the hang of the eat-wake-sleep but  when he did  was wonderful  He slept through the night at 8 weeks   now at 17 weeks takes 3 2-hour naps durg the day  sleeps 11 hours at  night I can wk my activies around their naps so that their waketime is  filled wh fun  love  my undivided attention!  I read the negative  reviews  do not agree wh most of them  This wked f us! Good Luck!
While still pregnant wh my first I was given much advice  several &quothow to&quot books  I am the type that likes to research  then come to my own conclusion  When you are sleep deprived you  will try anythg but don't make &quotBaby Wise&quot a way of le
Babies are f lovg not trag like milary recrus! This book makes  &quotconvenient&quot f the parent  hell f the child How would you like to be denied food  water just because  wasn't  &quottime&quot to eat yet?A carg lovg relationship  wh your baby cannot exist along wh the ideas  this book
Befe I got this book I read EVERYTHING about how to care f babies but nothg was specic enough My husb knew even less than I did  he is a doct We put my son on a schedule as soon as we got home from the  hospal  he started sleepg through the night at 4 weeks He happened  to be an active fant that fussed himself to sleep every nap  night f  11 months this book saved us from gog crazy about   givg us ideas  to help It gives clear guideles that helped us when we moved 6 time  zones when the baby was 8 weeks old The baby is now 18 months old  we  are constantly told what a well behavied ltle boy we have Other mothers  I know that use this system have also had great success My second baby is  4 days old  we are startg to put her on a schedule as well Just the  idea of knowg what to expect is valuable  she just ate 2 hours ago  then the cryg dicates somethg other than hunger  I can vestigate  other possibilies f her discomft I have used the second book  this  series   is even me wonderful
I was troduced to Babywise years befe havg my first child A close friend of me shared the book wh me  sce she had 3 great kids I thought I'd try  when my time came Sce then many of my friends have  used the prciples  Babywise wh excellent results  Do I follow the book to the  letter? No the good Ld gave me a bra  I do use  There's only one  book I would follow to the letter  that's the Bible (which is another  discussion)  I've read many books on parentg  Babywise was the one  that wked f us Parent-Directed feedg  havg her a route was  some of the best advice I was givg  I share the book wh all my friends  (but I don't look down on the  they choose not to use )  Most people  that I've given to book to come back later  thank me  I love my child   would do anythg f her I would recommend this book to any new  parent  If you don't like then don't use  But don't be so quick to  judge others
Yes this book is controversial but  wks!  As one reviewer said her baby still loves her  My baby is now 17 months old  has always been happy content  predictableThis book lays out the rationale f  scheduled feedg  sleep times  I thk the fmation given is  well-researched  documented  If you read this  try  out   decide that the method is not f you then that's okay but I advise you  to at least TRY IT!
I read Baby Wise three days after brgg my first child home from the Hospal saved me nights of unrest  My first two nights home I got very ltle sleepAfter readg the book  one dayI started usg a  schedule   wkedHe is now three  has slept 8-12 hours sce 6  monthes  I also have a 11 month old girl which I started on a schedule   the hospalnursg every three hours me  growth spurtsat 4  weeks she slept 6 hours  at two months 8 hours at nightnow 12 hours  wh 2 naps  the dayI give this book f baby shower gtsIT  WORKS
As a step mom to 3 birth mom to 3 foster mom to 50  adoptive mom to 2 we as a family have benefted from the prciples outled  Baby Wise  The greatest thg about this country is the freedom of speech   thank God we have the abily to make parentg decisions stead of a  gov't mated plan  Honestly we do suppt the material  Baby Wise  believe that  each of us have the right to make assessments on what we feel wks f us  When we build one another up not tearg down we will look me like the  Giver of Le  Babies are blessgs!
Although this book came highly recommended from a friend who had used the Baby Wise method successfully to help their child sleep through the night I didn't expect anythg to wk f my newbn triplets My confidence   the auth was boosted however when I read that he was the father of  triplets as well! Befe implementg the Baby Wise system our triplets  were beg fed &quoton dem&quot  as you might image this  resulted  our carg f them 24 hrs a day Someone always needed to be  awake We implemented the Baby Wise system on a Monday  by Thursday  ALL THREE of my triplets slept THROUGH THE NIGHT! Our lives were saved!  Once we put them on a schedule my babies were happier  healthier than  ever They slept better they ate better  they quickly learned to soothe  themselves Some reviewers of the book have suggested that this method is  cruel I couldn't disagree me In fact I believe that makg a decision  to allow your child to experience a small discomft  der to improve  their le  the long run is what parentg is all about This book will  help get you started developg your lelong responsibily
As parents my husb  I get all kds of advice from all kds of people  We take some  we leave some  We are defely &quotleavg&quot this  I realize that there are many acceptable ways to  parent a child but my trag as a psychologist  my stcts as a  parent tell me that the methods  this book are simply not acceptable   If you are strugglg wh your fant as all  parents do consider somethg dferent I love all of the books that  Sears  Sears have wrten  Try them  They are wrten by people who  clearly love children take a posive nurturg approach  who have a  knack f makg you feel good about yourself as a parent  By the way  their methods will probably require me time  commment on your part   But that's what parentg is all about isn't ?
This book has saved my sany! I dem-fed my two boys  they didn't sleep through the night until they were 7 &amp 8 months old I followed the guideles  &quotBaby Wise&quot  my baby daughter has not only  slept through the night sce she was 5 weeks old she is happy  content   goes down f naps whout a fuss! Sleepg through the night is not  just good f a happy Mom-- makes a well-rested happy baby too! My baby  is 4 months old now  has been sleepg from 8 pm to 8 am sce she  was 3 months old I also was not able to breastfeed my boys successfully  but she is nursg beautully Aga I believe this is because I  dem-fed them let them &quotsnack&quot they didn't get a good solid  feedg each time so they were contually hungry  fussy As the book  recommends I always make sure she gets a full feedg  I am thrilled to  be able to successfully nurse my baby this time! I was totally  anti-schedulg wh my first two but wh the results I have wh my  third baby I am a true convert! Don't get this book f your sake get   f your baby's sake Everyone deserves a good night's sleep!
This wks!  I thk  is a great GUIDE f a new mom  I was clueless  I wanted answers  And I used the book as a GUIDE not as my Bible  You have to use YOUR best judgment when  comes down to   F  everyone who condemns this book I thk you should use some good judgment  (like we did)  realize that you just take what you can use from the book   leave  at that  And  still wks!
I am ashamed to own this book  Mr Ezzo does not take  consideration the needs of a baby  Babies have growth spurts  need to feed when they are hungery  It is neglectful to follow Mr Ezzo's guideles f feedg a baby under six months of age   Babies learn to trust their parents when  parents respond to baby's cries  needs  Babies cannot tell time   will not learn to trust a parent who puts a baby on a schedule disregardg  the baby's needs
Anyone searchg f a manual of Christian parentg will please not stop on this book  There are many Christian parents who are appalled  que frankly frightened by this method of child rearg  These are the facts  about &quotBaby Wise&quot:This book is  frighteng unsafe  has the potential to become an epidemic  parents  don't filter this fmation through their bras AND their hearts   Remember that your baby  child have no one else to depend on - don't  desert him/her because you want a good night's sleep
This is child abuse  neglect  Most of the proponents know  is too  they wouldn't fill their reviews wh phrases like \\"who cares who says 's child abuse?\\"  \\" is NOT child abuse\\"       This book is premised on the idea that there is a rivalry between parent  child  that  is impossible to fulfill a child's basic needs -- even a newbn's needs -- whout somehow causg deprivation to the parent The practices urged by this book which is not wrten by pediatricians  child development experts deprive newbns  fants of parental contact  food that are essential to development  le  create a punive atmosphere that is as unnecessary as  is cruel     In fact parenthood is an awesome enough responsibily wh enough fodder f conflict (but not God help us when they are fants) whout begng your relationship wh your child  such a brutal way     There are many fmative sources f parents about child-rearg: the What to Expect Books the Gessell Instute Series Penelope Leach the American Academy of Pediatrics  even Dr Sears Unlike the Ezzos the books I've mentioned have been wrten by folks who have fmed developmentally-realistic expectations about children  who approach the parent-child relationship from a posion of goodwill (even when they don't necessarily agree wh each other)
This is an amazgly simple  sht book that I have used wh both of my children ages 3 1/2  14 months  They both began sleepg through the night at 8 weeks  are still sleepg 10 to 12 hours a night I have  given this book to at least 5 people as shower gts  they have all been  skeptical but eventually grateful f the simple advise The basic premise  is wake up eat play then sleep -  that der No where else did I  receive such detailed advise on puttg my children an a feedg schedule  As a nursg mother I was NOT nursg around the clock but at scheduled  times that were predictable This book will brg you sany  a good  night's rest
My we &amp I read Baby Wise when our boy-girl tws were 6 weeks old ( we wished we had read  6 weeks earlier!)  I'm  amused at the &quotcontroversy&quot over this book  the attacks from  the Attachment Parentg camp  the accusations of &quotchild  abuse&quot  My opion is that  is much me harmful to your children   they are chronically exhausted (not to mention the parent's exhaustion)  than a few nights of them cryg as they learn to fall asleep on their own   All I can say is that our tws are happy well-rested above-average  height &amp weight  still get all the love &amp nurturg that they  need If you're a parent of tws  me I believe Baby Wise is a  must-read!

I began to use this book when my first son was 8 weeks (8 wks too late!)  He is now 5 months (we've graduated to vol II) Ben now knows when he wakes up he'll be fed then he'll play then nap etc  I spent the first 8  weeks always wonderg \\"Why is he cryg?  Won't he nap  he's tired?\\"  (No)  Now Ben has a secure place  which to develop he TRUSTS that he  will be taken care of  He doesn't have to cry f anythg he needs but   he does I know why  Le isn't perfect but this predictable  environment is an essential foundation to a calm home le  a happy  baby True Ezzo's tone is sometimes annoyg but overall the book is a  great tool You can see below the conflict between soothg your child   lettg them cry rages on  I don't subscribe fully to eher I do feel  that wh every week of your baby's le this plan will be me dficult  to implement whout tears  But  you do  early  really pays off  I  am glad to discuss  you have me questions
I am usg this book wh my third child  let me tell you I wish I had  wh my first two!  I sure would have gotten sleep  I will be givg this book as a baby gt from now on!  You need to decided diviually   you like this book  not  Check  out from a library  you can  Once  you read  most of you Im sure will realize the common sense of   In a  nut shell the book says to feed your child keep them up f an hour  so   then put them down to sleepto fall asleep on their own not while a  bottle  breast is  their mouth  Thk of yourselfyou eat  dont  nmally go directly to bed wh about an hour after eatg is when you  could curl up  go to sleepwell s no dferent wh a baby  You are  still spendg qualy carg lovg time wh your baby  I dont see  where people are sayg s abuse/neglect  I just started today wh my 2  month old daughter  she is fallg right to the route!  Try  f  yourself see f yourself  will hurt nothg  no onerather develop  a nice route f you  your child one that you can &quotcount  on&quot  develop a wonderful lovg bond too!
My six month old was havg trouble sleepg  I tried the Ezzo approach  As I was stg behd to the do listeng to my son sobbg I realized that I wouldn't treat my wst enemy the way I was  treatg my child  I knew then that there had to be a way to help my son  sleep that every lovg stct I had didn't rebel at  I searched the  parentg books  found Smart Love by the Piepers  They expla why the  Ezzo approach is as bad as I thought  offer ways to help your child  sleep that don't volve tture f parent  child  My son now goes to  sleep coog  babblg to himself  I feel as though I have saved him  from emotional disaster  Smart Love is much smarter than babywise!
The doct's review is WRONG!   My mother after six children decided to try this method of schedulg my brother who is 16 years younger than me  He was the happiest of all the babies the most predictable  now  at 5 years old is able to enterta himself the best  Also implemented  wh my now 2 year old brother this system wked  There is no sense   refutg the teachgs from BABY WISE until you have tried !
This book is absolutely marvellous - I cannot speak highly enough of   Befe havg my first child nearly 4 months ago the only baby books I had read suppted the dem feedg  attachment parentg theies  I  found myself exhausted from feedg  holdg my baby constantly  Now  thanks to the guidance on On Becomg Baby Wise my baby  I fd  ourselves enjoyg a very flexible route  our days breastfeedg  happens easily we both have time f rests durg the day  my baby  sleeps through the night  This book seems to have been much berated by the  attachment parentg devotees but to me  has been a great salvation -   my baby is very happy thrivg  anyone can tell that she feels secure   loved!
My husb's advice about any book on advice is to use what you like  disregard what you don't like  This is what I've had to do wh this book I got this book because a friend of me said  changed her le  That of course peaked my curiosy on top of the fact that her 17-month old  knows sign language  Unftunately upon readg the book that's where my  fascation wh Parent-Directed Feedg ended  My daughter is soon-to-be  8 months old  I am still solely breast-feedg on a 3-hr schedule durg  the day  one feedg at night She is a very content  happy baby   I'm fever gettg compliments because of her  Ezzo leads you to believe  that  you don't follow his plan you will have a miserable cranky child  who will be avoided by friends  family  That was sultg Now I  don't believe that Ezzo is promotg child abuse but I also don't believe   allowg babies most especially newbns to cry  out  The idea that  babies cry because they are lettg off emotional stress sounds as  ludicrous to me as attachment parentg does to him  There is a way to put  a child  bed whout him beg completely awake  completely asleep that  satisfies both parent  child  A few mutes of wdg down rockg   sgg to a baby is not detrimental  He may whimper ially when  you put him down but that is much nicer than howlg f an hour which  Ezzo suppts  I suppose  you can tolerate  /   your baby goes  down  responds well to this kd of parentg go f !  My baby likes  her pacier when she takes a nap  goes to bed at night  she has  sce she was a week old  Ezzo calls a pacier a sleep prop that should  be done away wh especially at her age  Aside from dental concerns I  don't see how a pacier is any dferent from a blanket which many PDFers'  kids use  (PDF-Parent Directed Feedg)  I don't see what's so wrong   grantg a child what comfts him   s not potentially dangerous  le-threateng  beyond reason  I like the idea of a flexible route:  sleep feed  wake time  I commend Ezzo f not beg a clock  watcher however the idea that havg a baby is simply like passg the  baton  a relay race (there's no stoppg you just keep on runng) seems  absurd A baby changes one's le whether we like   not  Gettg back  to a route takes time  If me mothers rested  relaxed like they  were supposed to the first several months  might lessen the frenzy to  get to a schedule  I don't mean to igne the wkg mother but  her  case f the most part a caregiver dictates the schedule of the baby  durg the day  as f mothers wh other children  a  child-sensive household each child is  turn taught to be  parent-sensive   In my opion the fear that a child will usurp his  parent's authy  his biological clock is not regulated asap by the  parent is an extreme attempt to counter permissive parentg  F a me  baby-sensive (versus baby-centered as Ezzo calls attachment parentg)  approach to parentg specically Christian parentg I would recommend  books by William  Martha Sears who not only have years of clical  experience but are the proud parents of eight children  Beware though  Ezzo attacks this type of parentg  yet both Sears  Ezzo claim to  be Christians  The call is ultimatly yours but I would suggest readg  both views to get a balanced perspective  Most of all I would be  confident as a parent to use whatever methods feel right to you  your  child to raise them to be happy well-adjusted  respectful
I don't get !   These people callg this book dangerouschild abuse etc  If you read the book  like any book don't take anythg to extremes then I'll tell you what is a fabulous method of brgg calm to you  your baby  It is a wonderful  lovg book  I know at  least 10 families who have used   really say they thought  was a  lesaver!  Please don't listen to those bad reviews!  I really don't thk  they could have possibly read the book  tried !
Newbns cannot be &quottraed&quot as this book suggests  Neher can they relieve their hunger  thirst whout their parents help Thisbook is chock full of unfounded claims based on shoddy research  The notion  that your childs personaly will be adversely affected by nocturnal  feedg is absurd  This is not to say that there aren't some common sense  prciples this book but they are carried to an extreme  Please talk  to your doct befe usg the prciples outled  this book
The Babywise book should be every mother's Baby Bible!  As the mother of newbn tws I was me than happy to adopt Gary's suggested baby schedule  voila both my babies slept through the night at 8 weeks (  on the same day!)  The book really wks is a Godsend f new  mothers mothers of multiples wkg-outside-the-home mothers  anyone  that needs baby structure  their lives!
I am appalled at the tone of this book that children are sucha nuisance  Nurturg children  the early years by allowg them toTRUST their parents not cry  out is the key to alot of this country's problems  If you want RESEARCH on a nurturg parentg approach read &quotAttachment Parentg&quot by Katie Allison Granju  Babywise is appallg
I read this book while pregnant wh my first child who is now 10 weeks old I would recommend this book to any parent  prospective parent who would like to mata their own sany  those early weeks  Not only is  our whole family sleepg through the night our son is a happy well fed  baby I am  so thankful f the fmation  encouragement that I found  this  book  I know my son is gettg everythg he needs
This is a wonderful common sense approach  Our baby is 4 months old  she started sleepg through the night at 7 weeks  She is perfectly happy  content all the time  Other couples wh babies that are around the  same age never cease to comment on how happy our baby always is   I know everyone is entled to their own  opion but by just readg most of these negative comments I'm sry I  just don't get   I have never seen any evidence of these  &quotnegatives&quot  our child   any other Baby Wise child that I  know  It's as  these people skim the book decide they don't agree wh  some of the pricipals  then decide to trash  because 's not the way  they would do   Oh well that's my opion  personally I will  contue to recommend this book to everyone I meet
I am an early childhood educat  traer  my husb is an educational psychologist  We were both shocked to read a number of reviews of this book which were not only negative but accusaty  The basic  tenets of this book are as follows:  Don't let children snack stead of  take a full feedg because they won't get the fatty hdmilk that comes   the latter part of the feedg each fant cry is not necessarily one of  hunger  distress - one must learn to distguish the baby's cries to  determe how to meet her needs a schedule f baby makes her feel safe   secure  allows f adequate rest which will contribute to health  happess  growth  It is obvious that some of the reviewers did not  read the book carefully  Never does  say not to comft  soothe your  baby  Ezzo constantly says to be flexible wh the route to meet your  baby's needs  Those whose reviews implied that we parents who follow this  route are selfish cruel  child abusg need to reread the book (  read  carefully f the first time)  If this program does not meet your  needs don't use !  However please refra from makg nasty remarks  wh nothg to back them up  My daughter has gaed two pounds  three  weeks is reachg developmental milestones ahead of schedule is happy   content  is a joy to be wh  I have the confidence (wh the help of  Mr Ezzo's book) that she will grow up  a lovg nurturg environment  as an imptant member of my family  She will underst that she is  imptant but that there are other people who exist as well  As a result  she will learn compassion  underst her place  the wld

We did not hear about this book until our second child was bn  Our first child did not sleep through the night regularly f his first two years  had trouble gog down easily f naps  We give this book to many of our friends as they  prepare to welcome a new child to their home - whether s their first  child  their fth
This book just took out all of the guess wk  was very logical  It also stresses the imptance of the family not just the baby  I recommend  to anyone who is havg a tough time  the first months!
We used this methods described  this book wh superb results  We did not experience low milk production  any of the other &quotsky-is-fallg&quot results predicted by the nay-sayers  Our  daughter is happy joyful well-adjusted  a wonderful companion   Don't let the Dr Spock devotees convce you that you must confm to  your child's every whim  That's nonsense!  The prciples  this book are  timeless  true  Read   then decide f yourself  It just makes  sense!
As a new momI thk this book really was wonderful f my baby &amp Iafter I put him on a shedule his mood became happier I was better able to figure out what he needed  The other unfavable reviews  listed were really missg the potIt makes me wonder  they really  READ the book What wks f some may not wk f others I would  recommend this book to any new mom!
As a health care professional I am appalled! Women who follow this regime have po milk supply because they are not feedg their babies enough Breastfeedg is supply  dem The me you nurse the me milk you  will make I bet we will see long term studies on this parentg style   fd screwed up kids/adults who are secure  have lower IQ's from low  glucose levels to the bra The first developemental stage is trust versus  mistrust This book is endsg mistrust Babies need thier basic needs  met  der to trust you Trust that you will come to them when they cry  Are you stupid enough to thk a baby is maniupulatg you? They are just  tryg to communicate - I am hungry wet cold tired Go to them meet  their needs  they will be able to move onto the next developmental  stageIf you  don't have the energy to have a few sleepless nights then don't have a  baby! Do not read this book  is rubbish
The concepts discussed are useful  wise  We have 2 children  have used these ideas successfully  Mr Ezzo is unfairly attacked by people who have jumped on a bwagon  Read the book yourself  Very few of the  cricisms are warrantedIn realy our society would be much better  off  the ideas suggested  this book became widely accepted
I doubt the wrer of this one ever had a child  If he did I feel very sry f 
Please do not fall f this book Parents of young babies are vulnerable to all kds of thgs we're often sleep deprived  totally bewildered by our new baby  This book preys on such securies  Many children have  been hospalized because their parents followed this book  Babywise is  nothg but a lesson  hatred It is a step by step guide f alienatg  your children  causg them physical  emotional harm
The children I know who were raised accdg the Ezzos' prciples are contented  well discipled while those I know of who have been raised accdg to the Sears' method are rambunctious  often out of control  though also happy (so long as they get their way!)  You can read reviews of people who  make false claims about the Ezzos such as sayg their method is based on  &quotconvenience&quot (this is merely an example of settg up a strawman   tearg  down obviously no lovg parent believes that convenience  is a guidg prciple  parentg much less the Ezzos)  you can fd  parents who followed the two approaches  look at their kids  I  encourage you not to take my wd  anyone else's wd f : look at the  results of these philosophies  see f yourself  Aren't your kids wth  ?
People are recommendg this book based on sleep  feedg alone  conveniently fgettg that THIS BOOK ADVOCATES CHILD ABUSE!  Gary Ezzo  the &quotEzzoes&quot advocate begng to slap at children   make them use &quoth signals&quot  It is like some victian  throwback to &quotchildren should be seen  not heard&quot  If  obedience is your bag  you fd sublimatg your own needs to your babys  f a few months to much - perhaps you should just get a dog stead?  Parentg is a privelege not a right  readg some of these reviews   sounds like the suppters of this style of parentg simply want to have a  child but make  f to their lives as seamlessly as possible as  they  really didn't have a child at all!As f &quotoh  my child is thrivg!&quot Did you know the babies of the Manson family  were also que well adjusted at age 1  2?  What's your pot?  Wa  until they are 25 then start proclaimg how &quotsuccesful&quot your  parentg was from the child's pot of view - not just your own
I thk Baby Wise is a great book I have used the parent directed feedg wh my first child who is now 4 months old she has been sleeplg through the night sce she was 9 weeks old   My husb  I have taken the directions from the Ezzo's  have adapted  f our daughter I thk  that is the key to usg this book Flexabily  your route is what has  wked f my family  I have recomended this book to several friends   family And I will contue to recomend  to everyone that has  is gog  to have a baby!
I am an extremely religious Christian Mother  I am sickened by what &quotBaby Wise&quot teaches  If you would like to read a truly Biblical book on Christian parentg please try &quotThe Complete Book of  Christian Parentg  Child Care&quot by William  Martha Sears  It  is based *strongly*  The Bible  is filled wh great scriptural  references that I have found very helpful  encouragg  &quotChristian  Parentg  Child Care&quot is truly GOD'S WAY   is fantastic  My  daugher is a blessg to be wh a joy to all who meet her  I  constantly receive compliments on how well behaved friendly  charmg  she isI would be Afraid  Ashamed to meet my Ld  Savi on  Judgement Day had I abused the children he trusted to my care  the  way that BabyWise suggests  I only hope that God Almighty has me mercy   love f Gary Ezzo than Gary Ezzo has f helpless fants [f Ezzo's  sake]  Thank God that Christ didn't decide to take the Convenient way out
I thk  is sacrilegeous to throw out books but this one went  the garbage I am very open mded when  comes to parentg approaches but this book is hribly one-sided  biased He uses very extreme examples  of other approaches to prove his pot   just looks ridiculous Befe  you read this book do yourself a fav  read me about Ezzo  his  viewpots Scary stuff!
As someone who teaches fant  newbn care  a local hospal I encourage anyone who is thkg of usg this book to do some research first  Some of the practices encouraged  this book are beg proven to  be *dangerous* to babies by all the new &quotcuttg edge&quot studies   Most of the other practices advocated  this book  not dangerous are  just bad parentg I read this book because  was recommended to me by my  structs as somethg I should read to know what NOT to do wh fants   babies   Please do your child a fav  skip this one   Read  &quotThe Baby Book&quot by Dr William Sears [who is beg widely  suppted by the newest research to baby's bra  emotional  development as well as general physical well beg]  Or check out  &quotAttachment Parentg&quot by Granju   This book  a quick fix f  &quotconvenient&quot baby care which will eventually lead to some really  unhappy families   There is no &quotEasy Way Out&quot wh parentg -  you eher do  right [which might be a ltle convenient at times - buy  why have a child  you want convenience?  Get a fish!]  you spend the  rest of your child's le makg up f past mistakes  tryg to do  damage control [probably unsuccessfully]   The happiest healthiest most  WELL BEHAVED children I know are the ones whose parents used Attachment  Parentg  PLEASE thk long  hard befe you buy to this &quoteasy  answer&quot method of screwg up kids   I promise you  your child  will be happier  you do
Befe you comm to this dangerous  misguided book you should compare  to the alternatives Check out the book &quotAttachment Parentg: Instctive Care f Your Baby  Young Child&quot by Katie Allison  Granju  &quotOur Babies Ourselves&quot by Meredh Small Why would a  parent want to allow her baby to cry  go hungry simply out of  convenience? The only thg this will teach your baby is not to trust  anyone
A friend of me who was a mother already recommended this book to me My mom bought  f me  I read  I thought  was a bunch of bunk I was told alot of that stuff from family members but I don't buy  I spent  many a sleepless night because my son was alone  his crib At age four  months I got sick of that  put him  bed wh my husb  I We like  him there   hasn't affected our marriage at all  my son began  sleepg thugh the night I also picked him up when he cried I didn't  run  at the first ltle peep but I refused to let him scream  cry  He just wanted to be held Personally I believe this method DOES NOT spoil  a child just shows them they are loved  protected My son is two  now  he has never experienced separation anxiety is friendly  not at  all shy If I want to spoil him I will let him get his way all the time  Lovg  holdg your child can't spoil them If people don't want to  have sleepless nights aren't willg to give up some time  decide that  schedulg a baby so that their personal  private isn't disrupted  any  way is what's bestthey shouldn't not have children I'm sry my mom  spent money on this book Love your children hold them hug them   enjoy every second you have because someday they'll be to big to rock
Babywise rates NO STARS at allBabywise is anythg but *baby* wise  It has ltle to  do wh der f *baby's* day  rest f *baby's* night  It is clearly  *parent*-centered  selfish  It revolves around a grown-up wld   caters to adults who wish to contue their own lestyle whout beg  convenienced by their children  Please look elsewhere f sound fant  care advise!
I have read the reviews f Babywise on this webse  although this book may not wk f *every*  baby  does wk f the majy  Yes babies do make their own schedule -- to a degree  Parents are certaly  able to shape how their babies schedule comes together wh the result  beg happier babies  This book preaches route *wh*  flexibily   That's the key A schedule will never wk whout the element of  flexibilyThe book does address issues such as growth spurts   decreased milk supplies at night  how to get around these issues wh  the program  I highly recommend this book to any new parent but don't  fget that your baby is an dividual  Feel free to experiment usg the  book as your guide  Don't make any one program your Bible
Newbns can be so convenient!   Can you image comg to a place bld unable to speak unable to gesture  ravenously hungry?  All you can do is cry  how dare you - the people God placed you wh have a  dferent schedule  Sry agenda  Tsk Tsk
I've read some negative reviews on this book at this web se  All I can say is that thanks to this book ltle Adam started sleepg through the night  his seventh week  He wakes up smilg every day  As Ezzo says   the book the sound of cryg from distress is que dferent from cryg  to unwd so let them cry a ltle!  There is nothg cruel about lettg  a child relax himself  Also children are happy when they're  a secure  pleasant environment not a sleep deprived  grumpy household!
It makes sense   wks  Very practical  do-able   No psycho babble just the truth  defately wth the time to read
I eagerly read Babywise  everythg else I could get my hs on befe the birth of my son Everythg has to be taken wh a gra of salt but I wholeheartedly recommend Babywise Ezzo says that providg structure   route is crical to makg your baby feel safe  secure  his new  wld but he warns agast fesakg flexibily  the name of route  I followed the basic prciples of Babywise  my son has thrived Not  only did he succeed  sleepg through the night at 8 weeks of age but  the comft of a regular route has allowed him to be extremely adaptable  when the need arises My son (now 10 months old) is easy to take places  travel wh  most imptantly a joy to be around In contrast my  friends who have started wh dem-feedg their children every hour (  sometimes me frequently than that) are now dealg wh toddlers who are  tellg their parents what to do can't be left  church nurseries   don't underst why Mommy can't stop nursg the new baby to get him a  toy! I truly believe that when children aren't taught to be part of a  family un (whatever that means  your suation) we are settg the  stage f teenagers who don't take responsibily f their actions   adults who don't function well  society I enthusiastically recommend Babywise as a startg pot  f childrearg to all of my friends
I thought the book was terestg but  did not wk well f me The auths spend 3/4 of the book sayg why the method is so wonderful but do not spend enough time explag how to get your child to sleep I found  that just puttg my daughter down f a nap as they say to do did not  wk SHe could cry f hours  until I could not st  anyme And  then I felt like a failure because I could not get her to sleep whout  rockg her THey do not give much help wh how you should just get your  child to fall asleep on her own therefe the book was potless to me I  would only recommend this book to someone wh an easy baby who falls  asleep easily Then the schedulg idea will wk wonderfully
I honestly didn't believe   I poked fun at those who tried to keep their babies on schedules Well my first bn didn't sleep through the night until she was 3 1/2 years old Now my second is 7 months old I was  lterally gog out of my md wh lack of sleep Friday I decided to  &quotbe the bullet&quot  try this It is Sunday  I am so glad  that I did because I had a full night's rest last night The schedulg  will take a few me days to adjust to but we are well on our way As f  my daughter who is 7 now there are clear signs of her not beg on a set  schedule from early on I am gog to apply some of the concepts f her  also Hopefully she wont be so cranky anyme!
Say what you want  My we  I began to use the sleepg program when our first son was seven weeks old  wh three days he was sleepg through the night (7 hours at first soon 9-plus hours straight)  Now he  is 6 months  has only awakened once  the night (he had a bad cold)   the past 4 months!  Amazg  He is happy  99th percentile  height   weight  I know 15 couples who have tried Ezzo  only one disliked   (they did so f polical reasons)  I've become convced that dem  feedg family beds child-centered homes etc are destroyg our  children
I would just like to pot out the fact that the wd TRAINED is actually  the TITLE of this book  This comment is directed at anybody who asserts  that Ezzo is not promotg child TRAINING (as I read  one review)
Anyone who advocates spankg babies is sickMy advice to the Ezzos:   pick on someone your own size you cowards
When you read any book you have to add your own common sense  tuion to the mix I read this book  found  VERY helpful   establishg a route f my baby She appreciated  too She's thrivg!  She started sleepg through the night at seven weeks She's now seven  months old  is  the 85% f weight  length She takes regular naps   eats on a regular schedule She loves her nighttime route of a bath  befe bedtime I believe she appreciates knowg what to expect each day  She is as happy  healthy as any baby could possibly be I never had to  let her cry herself to sleep--maybe I'm lucky but maybe I gaed her  trust by respondg to her needs That's what I read  this book When I  read others extremely negative reviews of this book I wonder  you  actually read the same book The auths clude several caveats to not  take their guideles to extremes Did you not read these parts of the  book? Anyone who can rely on their own common sense will fd this book  very helpful
We followed the &quotBaby Wise&quot program wh our first child  she is a dream  We have raised her  a calm household wh a regular route  have reaped the results  She is well behaved happy   stable  She started sleepg through the night at 7 weeks  now at age  2 has made the transion to a &quotbig girl bed&quot wh ltle   no fuss  We will follow this program wh our second child   highly recommend  f new parents!
Jesse Ventura was right when he said that ganized religion was f weak-mded people  Anyone who advocates htg a child should be arrested f abuse  My husb was h as a child  he has had to deal  wh all sts of issues as an adult such as physical abuse towards me  etc  Now that he's on Prozac he swears his mother co-authed this book!   Just bizarre  I shudder to thk about these babies when they get to be  adults This book should be listed under the comedy section
After receivg Baby Wise at a baby shower I started to read  crically wonderg   was wth   Much to my delight  was  My daughter was 5 weeks old when I began readg the book  I started  implimentg the suggestions as chapter by chapter as I read through the  bookWhat I like most about the book is the route  I know from  wkg wh children that a route helps them feel comftable   confident  Ezzo's book does not dem a rigid route but explas how  to assess the baby's needs  a route  There is no guesswk!  This book  teaches parents how to be effective parents
I bought the Babywise book after havg spent a weekend wh a family of 5 children!  Most of you will have 'hr' sties already fmg  your md at that statement  But to the contrary they were the most well  mannered helpful children I've met  The mother  father were relaxed  wh them (even at MEALTIME)!  The ages ranged from 2 to 9  she was  pregnant aga!  I asked them &quotWhat's your secret?&quot  First they  said &quotGod&quot Second they said &quotWe have used the Babywise  method wh all five&quot  I was pregnant at the time so I ran to my  computer  bought the book  I  encourage any new ( not so new) mothers to buy this book  establish a  consistent age appropriate route f their child(ren)   F us  has  made havg a child a wonderful not traumatic experience
Of all the books f new parents that I've read this one was the most helpful  My new baby was not only sleepg through the night (8 to 9 hrs) by 8 weeks old she is now two  I have never had any problems gettg  her to bed  the eveng  at nap time She has been nothg but a  complete joy to us  I thank the auths f helpg us to avoid some of  the common frustrations new parents face Nothg replaces common sense   I found nothg  this book &quotmean&quot &quotuncarg&quot etc  as some crics dicate If you are a new parent I highly recommend you  read this  make your own decision as to follow the advice  not
Readg this book I would not even bother to follow any of the guideles provided From the very start everythg sounds a ltle too hokey Ezzo is not even a child specialist He is a mister whout any background   child development He will even cred his we f the 'child expert'  credentials  she is not even listed as an auth of the book Takg  care of your child this way is not lovg  comftg Ezzo does not  believe that bondg between child  parent exists rather he would like  you to impose a schedule on your child whout takg to considerg  respect love  care f your baby I don't thk he has ever really  looked directly to a baby's eyes  seen the matury  understg  that a mere fant knows just by the parent holdg him  soothg him  Eventually your child will 'make' his own schedule Don't rush --he just  got to this wld  is still tryg to settle to !
A lot of the reviewers here are  my opion beg a b too generous  This book is dangerous especially f first-time parents  It gives directives not advice  It also says  essence  the auths' fmula  doesn't wk 's the parents' fault  I can tell you that we tried   their way   didn't wk  This book caused us heartache but  everythg is fe now  (We usually donate our books after we're fished  wh them  Because we didn't want to be responsible f anyone even  accidentally gettg ahold of this book we just threw  away)Love  your children  tough  out  Eventually they will sleep  Our  daughter has been an excellent sleeper sce she was seven months old  The  &quotBaby-Wise&quot system caused me problems than  prevented
While many pick up this book to learn how to help baby sleep through the night the most imptant comments come at the begng of the book  will help you raise a confident dependent carg child  The premise is  to tegrate a child to your le  family not restructure your le  to revolve around a child  This book was highly recommended by a number of  my friends -- mostly new older (mid to late 30's) moms  It was just what  I needed  It confirmed my own thoughts on how to raise baby  guess what  --- matched just what many of our own moms did  I did not fd   &quotrigid&quot at all--  fact the auth specically tells parents to  tail his suggestions to their own lestyle  This is my fave baby  gt to new moms
I am a mother of young triplets  I've read many books on parentg - the me I learn thgs that can help me deal wh my triplets the better!  While this book is recommended by many triplet parents I do not agree   The ONLY thg I found useful is their ideas on schedulg  Schedulg is  very necessary to survive havg triplets  But many of the other ideas   my opion are not good f babies  Babies under 6 months should not have  to &quotcry  out&quot  be fced to adhere to a parent's schedule   there were many other thgs  this book that sent shivers down my  spe  Dr Ferber's techniques are much better  he is a doct not a  religious man wh an agenda  The auth of BabyWise doesn't mention   his book that his prciples are based on his highly controversial  religious beliefs  practices If you do decide to get this book please  take all that he says wh your own common sense  a &quotfew huge  gras of salt&quot  NEVER DO ANYTHING JUST BECAUSE A BOOK SAID SO ----  USE YOUR CONSCIENCE AND BETTER JUDGEMENT  all thgs
I read this book  as a new mom was lookg f the perfect sleepg solution f my new son This book ially appealed to my own predisposion f der  route However I had uneasy feelgs as I  concluded the book I came to realize that nothg can replace the  God-given maternal stct Although I agree wh a good b of what Ezzo  recommends I don't believe he is the end-all on child rearg Dr James  Dobson does not recommend their techniques I recommend to perhaps read the  book but don't let Ezzo's advice be the last wd My child (now two)  didn't sleep through the night until he was 7 months but now is an  excellent napper  night-sleeper Ezzo scares me a b wh his rigidy
Baby Wise was recommended to me  my husb befe we had our first child  Befe readg this book we were not sure how we would hle parentg  IT ALL MAKES SENSE!!!  Our Baby Wise baby has been great wh  all of the advice of the book  Wh schedulg our daughter has  accomplished so many thgs  She began sleepg through the night on a  regular basis at 5 1/2 weeks old  Amazg huh?  No  is not luck  It  is a system that we had followed  (This is the same system that wked f  ALL of my siblg's children  Cocidental I don't thk so)  This book  offers great guideles  that is exactly what  isGUIDELINES!  It  never once says that  has got to be one certa way f ALL children   But  you wk hard  will wk We have  really enjoyed parentg  can't wa to do  a second timethanks to  Baby Wise  Now we our on our way to buy Baby Wise Part II
I am amazed to see the number of reviews  that each seems to be eher a &quot1&quot  a &quot5&quot  While I was pregnant I received very ltle education on what to do wh a baby once he was brought home  After  about a week of no sleep  no idea what we were dog my husb  I  read this book at the recommendation of a friend  We immediately started  to use some of the ideas sce what we were dog (caterg to every cry   moan of the baby) wasn't wkg  Wh a couple of weeks our baby  was gog to bed awake fallg asleep  his crib  sleepg wh only  one middle of the night wakg (2 AM I remember  well!)  By 8 weeks he  was sleepg from 8:30 PM to 7:30 AM  he has been a perfect sleeper   napper f 2 years!  He is happy all the time  when I go to put him down  f a nap  bedtime now he says &quotnight night mommy&quot blows me a  kiss  hugs his Bert  Ernie dolls rolls up  his fave  &quotblankey&quot  closes his eyes  no fussg  cryg at all!   My friend who told me that this type of child treatment would cause  permanent mental damage was still wakg up wh her child every night  after she was a year old!  I thk that children want disciple   route from their parents  Instead of this program sayg &quotI don't  care&quot   says &quotI do care  that's why I'm gog to the  extra efft to make sure that you get the right amount of sleep  eat at  the right times&quot  GREAT BOOK!
I gave a review of Baby Wise on Sep 4  I just had to second that by sayg: Our baby wise baby was 8 weeks old yesterday  slept through the night f the first time I feel confident  the program Usg 's  advise  a ltle common sense you can't go wrong I am so disturbed by  the negative reviews because they just aren't fair  accurate They sure  don't sound like the opions of people who actually read the book!  And  also not someone who gave  a fair try  I am a mother of four  none of  my children have suffered because of a recommended 2-2 1/2 to 3hour max  feedg schedule You can  should teach your new bn to fill their  tummys at feedg time The ltle efft  takes to keep your baby awake  to feed well will me than pay off  the end  should by no means be  looked at as cruel treatment  They don't suggest Cheese water tture   any thg Just lovg guidance to help them to achieve what will be a  healthy eatg pattern leadg to a full tummy  a happy baby awake  a  peaceful baby asleep  I fd  far me cruel to allow your child to  unknowgly create bad eatg patterns that lead to po milk supply   po sleep habs  Because they are just that habs  Habs that YOU  are responsible f creatg NOT a new bn who doesn't know any better   You have to take control  teach them Baby wise is a great tool Use 
This book contas dangerous  harmful fmation that is not accepted by the American Association of Pediatrics  is not suppted by medical research Many fants have suffered failure to thrive as a result of the  rigid unnatural feedg practices Mothers harden not your hearts toward  the cries of your children
On July 151999 I became a mother f the fourth time  I read Baby Wise just weeks befe our baby was bn  All I can say is I wish I had  eight years ago when our first was bn The suggestions made  this book  are practicle common sence you can see the wisdom  Our seven week old  baby puts himself to sleep whout fussg  He nurses on schedule you can  set a clock on him! Now he is sleepg six hours at night nurses  then  sleeps an other four to four  a half me We are well on our way to  sleepg through the night! All I can tell you is do yourself  your baby  a fav  read the book  then pass  on to your friends who are  expectg  It's money well spent wh many returns     A Happy Family   Vero Beach Fl
like roll over  give me a paw  Oh you mean this book is f &quottrag&quot babies?Frankly this book scared me  The rigid &quotone-size-fs-all&quot schedulg assumes all babies f  the same  mold I would have gave  *no* stars  I could have
This book wks Our baby is happy well fed  well rested She is a joy  people always comment how happy our baby is People also comment on how well rested we are Our baby has been sleepg through the night  sce about 9 weeks She wakes up every mng coog  talkg  her  crib  she is all smiles when we pick her up We have a healthy  babyA big thanks to the Ezzo's We have a happy  healthy well loved baby
I can't believe how many people thk bad of this book sce 's actually the best thg i've read sce i got pregnant I couldn't believe  but my 3 month old is sleepg already from 8pm to 8am  havg 5  meals  the day F those who say 's unhealthy my baby girl has  doubled her birth weight  some me besides she's hardly ever fussy  I'll always be greatful f the person who recomended  I've let a couple  of friends brow    wked f them too
I was thrilled to get ahold of a copy of Baby Wise as I had heard  would solve all of my 4 month old's sleep problems  Unftunately I've had only partial success  I do believe that the eat play sleep schedule  has made my baby somewhat happier  easier but Ezzo leaves no room f  flexibily (despe his claims)  My son seems to fight sleepg durg  naptime  no amount of &quotcryg  out&quot gets him to sleep  He  just stays up  gets crankier  crankier  Ezzo says:  you put your  baby on a schedule he'll sleep great  be happy  contented  But he  never mentions what to do  your child does not settle to a  scheduleI've found that people are eher Baby Wise fanatics   detracts wh few  the middle like me  I thk people assume that  because Baby Wise wked f them  must wk f everyone  you're  dog somethg wrong  's not wkg f you OR folks thk that  because  didn't wk f them  is a cruel  humane way to care f  baby  I say: try   may be just the ticket but remeber no program  wks f all babies all of the time
This book remds me of the dog obedience trag I completed wh our puppy just pri to havg our daughter  If you want to raise your child like you'd tra your dog -- wh obedience to the &quotmaster&quot   complete disregard f the child's feelgs  emotional well beg then  this book is f you!
It took a ltle longer than I thought  would but  was well wth When we put our baby down f the night she doesn't fuss at all  She's 10 wks old  sleeps through the night  People always remark on what a  good baby she is  It really gave us direction as first time parents
This book came highly recommended to me when I was pregnantwh my second child  my first was  the &quotterribletwos&quot When I read  I was frankly hried  These books should be renamed &quotParent Convenience Trag&quot This philosophy is so disrespectful to children  The overall tone of the book is scary  sidious but you are cautioned to be &quotflexible&quot  followg their advise (like &quotyour child will be immal  out of control  you don't follow the schedule -- but do be flexible!&quot)  Both of my sister--laws are usg Ezzo's books (one is usg Raisg Kids Gods Way -- the same book but wh the Biblical justications f everythg)  While their children one has a one year old  the other a 3 month old do cry very ltle  are very docile I believe this is because they've been left to cry  out so often they now figure what's the use?  An fant's primary stct is to survive   that means adaptg to a rigid schedule  beg isolated  not allowed to cry  der to be accepted of course the program will appear to &quotwk&quot My one brother  his we are both busess executives  have a nanny who meticulously follows Ezzo's program at their sistence  The baby often goes days whout seeg eher of them sce the rigid schedule they have adopted f him calls f him to rise at 7:30 am  go down at 7:30 pm  they are usually eher puttg  extra hours early  late  travellg They thk beg a parent is easy --   is f them!  -- But at what price has this come I wonder?  How emotionally healthy will a child grow up to be who receives the message as a ty fant that essentially &quotI will only love you  you f to my schedule  do exactly as I direct you to do --  suffer the consequences&quot?  So much f uncondionally lovg of your children  Isn't  common knowledge by now that children who are raised by condionally lovg parents end up  therapy (hopefully)  are unable to mata a healthy timate relationship? As a wkg mother of two  would have been very convenient to buy to the idea that as long as my new baby was clean  fed  was ok to leave her to cry  out  However I knew stctively trsicly that this was dead wrong  I hauled myself to the office many a mng after long nights spent holdg  comftg my baby  But  was wth  My children now 5  2 are extremely bright curious emotionally-healthy empathetic towards others well behaved  all-together wonderful My children speak their mds to my husb  I but are respectful  They tell us  they are feelg sad joyful sillywhatever  They are willg  able to articulate their feelgs to us because they know our hearts are always open to them  there is no &quotschedule&quot to dictate when they may experience our love f them
This is a crazy book The schedulg is so confg that you would be unable to have any le at all There is no room f flexibily such as gog out of the house to do errs The strict feedg schedule is  compatible wh hungry babies Yes your le will change when your baby  arrives but you can cpate the baby to your le I've read many  parentg books  would recommend &quotThe Baby Book&quot by William  Sears MD  Martha Sears RN Also f breastfeedg mothers I caution  that by followg Ezzo's recommendations f feedg schedulg you will   effect be reducg your milk supply  will end up wh a cryg  unhappy baby Follow the AAPs breastfeedg guideles stead which are  to breastfeed when the baby shows signs of hunger (not a schedule)  that  cryg is a late dication of hunger
This book is fabulous!!!!  I have given  to a zillion new parents  they have thanked me over  over aga  Basically what  boils down to is makg your child go on a schedule   makes all the sense  the  wld  These parents who most likely thk the child controls the roost  are beg a b hypersensive to the suggestions of the book  It is a  lesaver   does wk wh patience  However those babies needg  special care (ie colic) are the exception  My son who is now 13 months  takes two naps durg the day (one will be dropped by 18 months)  sleeps  through the night wh no problems  He's beg dog this sce 10 weeks  thanks to this book  TRY IT!!!!!!!!!
I am very disturbed by those people who feel this book is dangerous  I am very sry f those people who do have special needs children  should rely on medical advice  Chances are there were problems pri to begng  the Baby Wise program  This book does require the use of common sense  My  husb  I used this book as a guide  We did not let our daughter  &quotscream&quot  As the book suggests  there is  &quotscreamg&quot gog on then there is other thgs that need to be  addressed - ie is the baby sick?  Perhaps there is a problem wh the  mother breastfeedg (letdown problems  just general lack of milk) f  the fmula-fed baby an allergy to the compounds wh the fmula   This book has helped us fulfill JOY (JESUS  OTHERS  YOU)
I'm preparg to send a copy of this book to some friends who are expectg an fant  I made the mistake of readg some of the &quotone star&quot reviews that some people felt cled to give  I have to say  that I am furiated wh the suggestions that the prcipals taught   this book are abusive  any way  They read  wh a skewed outlook  I  strongly resent the accusations made toward those parents who were  telligent enough to underst what this book is tryg to teach  have   wk  I read the book pri to havg my first baby  felt so much  me confident about brgg her home because we had some idea of how we  would try to do thgs  I won't say  was always easy but we knew what  we needed to do to help her develop   has been a beautul success   People comment constantly on how happy  at peace she is  She still has  an obviously bn strong will - no &quotwill breakg&quot gog on  here  She has her own ltle personaly  we would NEVER do anythg to  threaten that  But she is also obviously comftable wh &quother  Schedule&quot  It offers a sense of secury that parents can  should  give to their children
I am the father of 9-month-old tws bn 9 weeks early  The preemie ward  the hospal fed them every 3 hours  four weeks later when they came home they were on a great schedule  Usg the advice given  this book  we contued this schedule  then when we felt the babies were ready  cut out the 3 am feedg  By 14 weeks old they were sleepg 8 hours a  nightWhile I don't agree  wh everythg that the book advises the concept of gettg the baby on a  schedule is crucial f both the parents  the baby      I can't  image what  would be like to have tws that were not on a schedule
Let me summarize  f you  Feed your child at from 7am to 7:30am play wh her from 7:30 until 8:30 put her to sleep from 8:30 to 10:00  Repeat every 3 hours  At night don't play wh her  This is so stupid    doesn't wk  What  your child doesn't go to sleep  What  she has  colic  The book is silent on colic  Well almost  There is a paragraph  on page 148 which repeats self almost wd by wd on page 174  The  whole book is one giant overwrten exercise  puttg wholesome   pleasg wds together
This book suggests that you can safely impose a schedule upon your baby  So f those readers whose babies &quotgo wh the flow&quot the advice seems perfectly fe  However I disagree that you can generalize this  st of approach  Sure there are babies out there who can function even  thrive on scheduled feedgs  There are babies who can sleep through the  night at an early age  There are babies who are adaptable  cheerful   These I believe are each baby's bn abilies  personaly tras  NOT somethg each baby has learned from some method beg imposed however  &quotmodied to su the parents' gut feelgs&quot  After three kids  each of whom had dferent feedg sleepg  comftg needs  each  of whom just naturally fell to some st of agreeable schedule that  sued their own personaly ( didn't always su me!) I feel  confident  sayg that people who believe the advice  this book is  responsible f their children's thrivg  easy-gog approach to le  are kiddg themselves  These parents are purely lucky not clever   And I agree completely wh the serious concern that parents especially  new ones might risk their baby's physical  emotional health by  followg this advice wh a child to whom  is not sued  In the end   feels like an excuse f condong the methods of parents who aren't  willg to put  the time  efft  meetg their child's needs (this  from someone who has had two highly needy babies  one &quoteasy  schedulable&quot baby)  Of course you're gog to be tired  frustrated   those early ( maybe not-so-early) weeks  That's part of parenthood   But as adults we hopefully can see that the day-to-day dficulties are  me than outweighed by the joy  satisfaction of raisg a child  meetg their needs as THEY convey them to US not vice versa  Please just  listen to your baby not the advice  this book  All  is givg you is  permission to be less of a parent than you ought to be
Of my three children I was babywise f two of them What an dference this has made  my le!! I reccommend this book to anyone who asks why  is that my children are so cheerful  sleep through the night  why I  am obviously so well-rested f a mom who has three ltle ones Don't  listen to those who thk this book offers &quotabusive&quot techniques  this book has reasonable sound advice f those who are terested   lovg parenthood Those who see this as some st of anti-parentg may  need to fd a spt  some other way to express their anxiety  their  need to defend their version of parentg Buy the book enjoy your  children
My pedrician has seen an crease  health problems caused by this book namely dehydration  failure to thrive Below are the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics which are completely  counter to this philosophy The physical effects do not take to account  the profound emotional damage caused by fants who are beg taught that  their needs will not be met by their parents as they cry from hunger durg  growth spurts         The AAP has always advocated breastfeedg as the optimal fm of  nutrion f fants           December 1997 the AAP issued s  latest recommendations about breastfeedg fants The policy          statement says &quotNewbns should be nursed whenever they show signs of  hunger such as creased         alertness  activy mouthg   rootg Cryg is a late dicat of hunger Newbns should be nursed          approximately eight to 12 times every 24 hours until satiety  In  the early weeks after birth         nondemg babies should be aroused  to feed  4 hours have elapsed sce the last nurg&quot
We read all the cricisms of the book  Most seem premised on the supposedly extreme tactics  However note that the book advises parents to use their common sense  to adjust s advice accdgly  My we  I  used the basic premises  this book adjusted accdg to gut stct   common sense  our daughter sleeps like a champ  Everythg the  book said would happen has happened  She started sleepg through the  night at 7 weeks  she doesn't cry when she wakes up -- she  &quotplays&quot  the crib  she is always cheerful when she is awake   She has slept through the night (knock on wood) f 3 straight months  I  highly recommend this book  Do not be deterred by the cricisms -- read   yourself adjust  to f your values  goals  use    (Incidentally there has been some ciricism that Ezzo is a religious  zealot  My we  I are not particularly religious  have not found  the book at all &quotpreachy&quot  It is about sleep not religion)  We  are givg this book to all our expectant parent friends wh the same  advice:  read  wh common sense  you will get me sleep  have a  happier baby
Instructions  guidles are easy to follow I've shared the book wh many friends  everyone has experience the same success!
At 8 weeks old our baby was sleepg 8 hours straight at night  By easg him to a schedule he learned to expect some der to his day  Knowg what to expect  havg some structure is a source of secury  f your baby  This is not a harsh technique  When your baby is on a  schedule you can be too This is a great book to give you some guideles   But use your better judgment  You don't have to agree wh every  suggestion
I used this book to help wh our baby who was premature He is now a healthy  happy 13 lbs baby wh chunky ltle legs!!!Please respect other people's decisions to  use this book as a GUIDE (NOT A BIBLE)

When we brought our new daughter home from the hospal we had no idea what lay  ste f us - a night that would probably discourage us from havg any me children  Not beg able to go to bed until 4:30 am was  very upsettg  A friend had let us brow her copy of the igal Baby  Wise  We quickly scanned through the book to at least beg to nmalize  le aga  What a blessg  was!  At eight weeks she was sleepg  through the night  now beg almost three is a great joy to us  to  all that meet her  Thank you to Gary Ezzo  Robert Bucknam MD f  savg our sany!
This book is one-half common sense tips  the other half abuse f convenience sake of parents who don't want to be bothered by children - even their own  It will f nicely  the trash can
We used the prciples  this book wh both of our babies wh tremendous success  We now have a healthy  happy 3 year old  1 year old who are well behaved self confident  such a blessg to our  family  I'm so sry this book has gotten so much bad publicy  I  believe the Ezzos have a deep love f children  that their suggestions  are deed wise
My first child came home from the hospal on a four hour schedule  slept through the night at 6 weeks  She just came to the wld that way  I knew I would never be as lucky wh our second child  I bought the book  while pregnant after seeg the results of friends who had a rough time at  the begng wh their babies but then saw amazg results wh 10  weeks I believe that people who are so opposed to this book thk that you  must follow  exactly  You should go wh what is comftable f you   I as most of my relatives  friends all used this book as guidele but  also had their own way of dog certa thgs  You must go wh your gut  feelg because every child  family is dferent  The ma negative  comment I have is that the book basically assumes that all mothers can   will breastfeed  At times  was dficult to make the bottlefeedg  connection wh all of the suggestions  However at week 8 my son startg  sleepg nappg  eatg on a schedule just as the book suggests  If  you stick wh the approach  will fally all just &quotclick&quot one  day  you will fd that le is happy f your baby  his  her happy   restful parents
I am amazed what a simple book can do  If you read the reviews you would thk there was a war between opposg zealots each preachg that their way is the right way f YOU  I have news f all of you:  Your way is the  right way f you  If you don't like the advice  this book don't  cpate  to your parentg  If you do like the advice try to  learn from   use   The subject matter is certaly not tended to  be abusive to children  N however is  applicable to everyone who  reads   Books share ideas  They do not fce you to do anythg   The book is fe  We use some of the advice but we are flexible enough  to jettison other parts  Which sections do we personally use  not use?   That's none of your busess!  My advice f all of you is to own   read me than one book on parentg  then wk thgs out f  yourself  Get a grip people befe you go mad
I've been readg the reviews   response to the negative reviews about this book I ask youDid we read the same one?  This book is an excellent resource  has wked very well wh my first son who is now 4  months old  sleeps through the night  He is thrivg  has already  doubled his birth weight  Ezzo never said &quotigne your baby's  crys&quot  His book gets you to thk about why your baby is cryg  He  never said &quottra&quot your child  He said parent your child  This  book helps you to really thk about each suation  your child's le so  that you can really get to know your baby  better be able to meet his   her needs  Use what wks f you  igne what doesn't  Beg flexible  is the key  by the way Ezzo talks about flexibily  almost every  chapter  This is defatley not the rigid cruel approach so many are  makg  out to be  I recommend this book to be used along side What to  Expect the First Year  Good Luck!
I am not one to wre reviews but I certaly can speak from personal experience about the mers of this approach to helpg your child establish a restful sleepg pattern  It wks  really wks   Don't by swayed by the naysayers whom no doubt are so negative because  they haven't had a good nights sleep  que some time
We probably would not have our daughter wh us today  I did not read this book f parentg suggestions I read  to see what the buzz was about why people are eher f  agast this book  And now I know   Any book that offers a quick fix--especially  the parentg arena--is  gog to be received this way  This is because every parent at some pot   another is gog to fd le wh a baby--a child of any  age--dficult  Parentg is an endeavour fraught wh emotional upheaval   often we turn to &quotexperts&quot f help advice  suppt   The consequent legion of parentg books has replaced our human communy  our village  Some books--BabyWise beg one of them--seek not only to fill  the gap left by this cohesive group of human begs but to replace the  parent as well Bottom le children are not f trag  They are f  lovg  Children should be seen  heard  Children's needs should be  met  F  their cries brg no response-- not the response necessary  to assuage fear hunger discomft--the child will grow wh a  considerable gap  his/her abily to empathize  The child will quickly  learn that his/her needs are not valid  The child will learn denial not  truth  Sure the same child may very well sleep &quot10 hours a night  wh 2  3 naps durg the day&quot  What else is there to do  one  feels even the slightest lack of love at such a tender age? Had we chosen  this &quotmethod&quot f our daughter we would have lost her  She had a  specic MEDICAL problem that was not adequately diagnosed f over a month  after she was bn-- durg that time she STOPPED BREATHING  turned  BLUE me times than I can possibly remember  Thank God she was always  wh me  Thank God f family bed  Thank God I trusted my stcts over  the misfmed wds of a certa Gary Ezzo  God is not  his disjoted  wds He is  my heart  And because of this my daughter is still wh  us nowa happy dependent lovg  empathetic two  a half year  old
Please do not be lured to thkg that a baby can be traed to igne his/her basic needs like hunger attention  sleep Please do not make your babies cry f you at night This man  his ideas are a cult Those  that follow his so called Trag courses are told to keep their methods a  secret  are warned not to talk about their methods to outsiders What  does this tell you?

A family member gave Babywise to me when I gave birth to my first baby  I don't know what I would have done whout  The book offers wonder ful SUGGESTIONS f raisg a happy  INDEPENDENT child I read the book  cover to cover  used the prciples  the book that I agreed wh Both  of my children slept through the night by eight weeks As a parent you are  the ultimate decision maker f your child This book encourages you to do  what you are comftable wh while followg their prciples  leaves  room f YOUR judgement as a parent You can tail your childs schedule to  your  your childs needs This book is f parents who are not willg to  let their child run their le  realize that children are happier wh  route  boundaries!!!! This book can help you help your kids to become  happy  dependent dividuals
This book sts on 's own settg the stard f trag your child  his  her own best terests right from birth  If you read wh a closed md  wh presupposions you may get the idea that parents who  use these methods are self-centered  On the contrary any parent who wants  to show their child how much they love them can fd a means to do so   this book  Usg the book doesn't mean  will be easy but  will be  better  Most of all keep  md to be flexible
This is the most hrible book I have ever read It amounts to child abuse Our daughter woke up nightly f nearly 2 1/2 yrs yet we were never sleep deprived Instead we used the night as a time to meet her needs f  closeness  nurturg If you don't want to parent your child don't have  one Please don't let new parents near this book  Our  children deserve better
Notice immediately that this auth has no child rearg credentials  Some of his books have an endsement from an MD (probably a frustrated proctologist)  If you read this  believe  is the answer to your  problems then I reccomend you not have anyme children  get a qualied  nanny f the one you have  Then go back to your schedule  make  everyone f to   Unbelieveable that this guy is still around
I am a nursg mother  a biologist  fd that the book makes very good sense   wks  I have the happiest baby  the wld  Of course you need to pay attention the the dividual needs of your baby!   And of course a schedule as the book pots out needs to be flexible!   But the overridg philosophy is that the baby tegrates to your  household to a secure  lovg pattern rather than settg up a  pattern of needg to cry f food  Babies that abide by this method   my experience are very secure happily go to bed at night  DO NOT CRY  much at all  Our ltle one is 3 now  the best sleeper I know (wh  the possible exception of my sisters baby who is also a Baby Wise kid)  I  thk that people get a misconception that babies will be cryg   demg but not receivg nourishment  Nothg is farther from the  truth!  Babies are happy to be put to a route--wouldn't you like to  know when your next meal is gog to come rather than shoulderg the  responsibily of communicatg hunger when you can't talk yet?  And   your baby seems hungry befe the next feedg by all means adjust the  schedulethe book talks alot about flexibily  I can't say enough good  thgs about this book  Try   see f yourself
The AAP The Wld Health Organization as well as every other reputable pediatrician disagrees wh this parentg &quotmethod&quot  This book is abusive to young babies  A mother has God given stcts to know how  to respond to her baby her entire hmonal system is geared to caretakg  her young fant  Her breasts are meant to feed her baby when her BABY  NEEDS TO BE FED  This book is NOT condusive to a breastfeedg mother   I guarantee that there is not one person who follows these strict feedg  schedules who breastfeeds beyond a year (which is recommended by the AAP)  The Ezzo's are NOT DOCTORS  PARENTING EDUCATORS  are not educated on  the make up of a human beg If you are lookg f a convenient way to  have a child who falls to a schedule  doesn't bother you too much  GET A DOG!
check out some reviews under his baby wise 2 book they will tell you the same sty he is an unwise man wh some very sadistic methods f Punishg an nocent child who can not reson at this age boycott all his  books stead buy other book from researched educated qualied auths
What a wonderful thg f a family to have - sany  I was prepared f the wst when our baby came but now I can't believe how unbelievably wonderful le is wh a baby  This book focuses on the family - the needs  of everyone   really wks!!!  Our baby sleeps 10 hours at night  takes three naps a day  wakes up happy  His route is great - perfect  f everyone  I know  makes our baby feel secure  It is so rewardg  to know that others actually enjoy beg around our baby - almost as much  as we do!!  It is also so rewardg to see our baby so happy I feel secure   knowg our baby is gettg everythg he needs
This book does go contrary to the Attachment Parentg philosophy that is also promoted by the LaLeche League folks  Breastfeedg yes full suppt but not &quotdem feed wear your baby all the time sleep wh  your fant child centered etc&quot  Children are a welcome member of  the family blessgs from the Ld  A &quotschedule&quot is to serve as  a guide not law  most of us do have some der to our lives  We  personally have had three birth children  over 45 foster children   have seen this common sense approach make very happy healthy children   The opposion to this book is to be expected but  each stance you  will need to consider the source give each a fair hearg  then  personally decide what you fs your family best
My husb  I were at our ws end our child was cryg  unhappy all the time  we were gettg ltle sleep  even less patient  We started babywise when our child was 6 weeks old  have not looked back  sce  She  started to sleep through the night about 2 weeks after we  began the schedule  at five months now she is a laughg joyous  gigglg bundle of happess  She sleeps f 12 hours a night (7:30pm to  7:30 am)  has 3 two hour napsher waketimes are full of adventure   developmental growth  She tells us now when  is her naptime by rubbg  her eyes  yawng  she is always right on time wh her schedule   Thank you f a wonderful system  a wonderful way to keep our baby  bright  happy
Why would anyone belive that swattg an 8-month-old baby is God's will? If God were stg  my kchen I scerely doubt he would recommend that I h my babies  Disciple them yes Teach them yes Guide them  yes I wry about the children whose frustrated misguided parents would  rest to these methods Even James Dobson has called the program &quottoo  rigid&quot The American Academy of Pediatrics is concerned enough to be  evaluatg the impact of this book There are many many good books on  disciple - please - f the sake of your children - pick another book
This book will give you great sight to basic parentg as well as teachg your child to wk wh YOUR schedule  Both of my children learned to sleep through the night based on the prciples  this book   It is a godsend!!
We are a Christian family  God blessed me my family  our baby tremendously through the use of Babywise (1&amp2)  The bottomle prciple to the books follows right along wh the Bible's teachgs  Our  relationship wh God is to be of #1 imptance mom's &amp dad's  relationship is second  imptance  third on the list of priies  is your children loved  welcomed members of the family  After readg  some of the negative reviews I have a question: In what way are the  prciples  practices of these books Biblically unsound?  I would  scerely like to see some responses from Christian parents out there
Dear Parents You may be frustrated sleep deprived  seekg help but the advice here may be dangerous to your baby's well-beg  BEWARE!!  Followg a set schedule may cause you to igne your baby's needs  underfeed  under-comft him  her  We know a couple who used this  book  the baby suffered failure to thrive  nearly was hospalized   The American Academy of Pediatrics has cautioned agast the use of this  book  considers  dangerous  My pediatrician says  should be pulled  from the shelves   Some babies can go longer times between feedgs some  babies can become &quotself-soothers&quot  but not most  If you require  this of your baby you will be teachg  that s needs won't be met   the wld is a threateng place   If you have a high-need baby  a  colicky baby  you're sleep-deprived  at your w's end get help but  not from this book
This book was easy readg  the philosophies shared by the auth can be easily implemented  my opion  My we  I got a late start wh our first child but  still helped out  the long run when we  implemented the tools  Wh our second child  has already helped   attag a set rounte that is beneficial both to our newbn as well as  f my We 2 year old  myself  If you've never had practice  child  condiong/rearg then the fmation shared  this publication is  f you  Try  out!  We did   has proven very effective as a  matter of fact  was so effective that we recommended to at least 10 of  our friends They have all tried   the majy have been very  pleased wh the outcome Jim Erlz
The method endsed by this book has been associated wh the hospalization of babies f severe weight loss  The American Academy of Pediatrics  Focus on the Family among other respected professionals  have cricized the methods as beg both medically  Biblically unsound   Use at your child's risk
This book was defely not f us  We tried  f about a month  just about went crazy  The recommendations were too dficult to follow  (Have you ever tried keepg a very young baby up?)They both take a tough st on gog to sleep when sleep is  needed which can be hard  What's dferent is their creria f tellg  when sleep is needed  Weissbluth's seems much me common sense to me   much less &quotextreem&quot
This book helped me wh schedulg  feedg of a new fant  Me imptantly  established why regulary is impactful f development  It is THE BEST BOOK f new parents
BabyWise is a guidele that we based our newbn son's route around  Not havg any experience as a parent this book gave us the basis f learng how to meet our son's needs  This book was recommended by a  family member who has a happy healthy 5 year old daughter  Our son is now  2 1/2  is on the same track as his cous  Both children are bright  happy  healthy  This book was not used by eher of us as a strict  method but rather as a guidele to help us all to adjust to the new  changes our lives had taken  Not once did we let our child &quotcry   out&quot f me than 10-15 mutes  If the cry was anythg me than  just a &quotI don't want to sleep now&quot cry we certaly did what was  necessary to make him happy aga  The best way to use this book is   conjunction wh other theies as well as  most imptantly wh your  common sense  your comft zone  I was shocked to hear that so many  people have found this book to be &quotdangerous&quotI truly encourage  any new experienced  frustrated parent to pick up this book  may  give you new sight to your parentg skills  I recommend  to any  parent that I meet  have actually lost track of my copy sce I have  loaned  to so many parents  I have never heard a bad review until I went  onle to der a book f a friend who is expectg  Read the book wk  wh your child  f the parts that are best to your lives you will  fd that  truly does wk!
Helps you learn to become a THINKING  RESPONDING parent  Real common sense parentg  It helped encourage a wonderful relationship (cludg extended breastfeedg) wh my daughter
My husb  I are first time parents  when we held our child  our arms f the first time we asked ourselves what do we do wh this precious child? Well this book will struct you how to get your baby on a schedule  that enables you to keep your sany  allows you to actually have a le   be  control of your child After readg the book  followg the  route our baby slept through the night when he was eight weeks old   now he is fteen months old  he is STILL sleepg through the night  This book has been the best resource f us thus far!!!!
The first night after readg this book my 7 1/2 month old son was sleepg from 8pm to 7am whout wakg Pri to that he would only sleep f 8 hours This book helped open up my eyes  get my son on a schedule  that is best f him-I know that because he took to  very easily He's a  MUCH happier baby  I'm a MUCH happier parent now
I showed this book to my baby's doct  he told me that many pediatricians are crical of   Evidently the scheduled feedgs have resulted  low weight ga  other problems wh babies  I thought the  book made a great deal of sense until I read the fmation  research  he gave me that said otherwise  He said that the techniques may wk but  that they are not what is best f the baby  He recommended books by Dr  William Sears Penolope Leech  T Berry Brazelton stead    I thought  this was imptant f others to know
I was very frustrated after the birth of my second child She seemed to want to nurse every hour  hardly slept at all A friend recommended this book  my immediate reaction was &quotwhat do I need another book f  I'm an experienced Mom&quot Thank  You Dr Ezzo!
I used the schedulg system recommended by this book  had a 7 week old baby that slept through the night (8 hours)  Now at 4 months my child is eatg every 4 hours (breastmilk only so far)  sleeps 12 hours at  night  I truly believe  the system this book describes  I don't know  ANYONE who used this book whose child was not sleepg through the night at  12 weeks  However I know several who decided the book was not f them   now have 1  2 year olds who wake up regularly  This system wks  (even wh breastfeedg mothers who are constantly told to FEED ON DEMAND  by docts  lactation consultants)  is flexible enough to wk wh  any lestyle
A co-wker wh a new baby recommended this book He said  wked &quotf him&quot As a first-time father I was amazed at how down-to-earth the suggestions were My we who had two children befe I  met her was terested  the &quotnew ideas&quot suggested  the book  Sce raisg a baby is the most imptant thg to get right the first  time we were both impressed wh the results I have bought the book as a  gt f expectg friends They have also told me  wks The proof is   the puddg Buy this book  you are a new  expectg parent It  wks!
I had great expectations f this book when I first purchased    sounded great  they  After actually puttg  to wk I was highly disappoted  It leaves too many questions unanswered like what  durg  your childs &quotsleep&quot time  doesn't sleep  just cries 's  way through  are you supposed to move on to the next scheduled  eat/awake/sleep schedule  let  sleep? It is also geared f breastfed  fants  gives very ltle direction f fmula/bottle fed ones   Lastly I totally disagree wh how the auths tell you to let your child  basically scream self to sleep  All that does is leave both you  the  child exhausted  your nerves are shot  Cryg is one thg screamg  is another  I tried the Babywise way f 1 week  after beg even me  frustrated than when I began I threw  away  guess what? My son put  himself on his own 4 hour schedule the next day  started sleepg  through the day after that (10 hours at a time at 8 weeks old) He does cry  at times but 's mostly a tired cry   he doesn't stop after 5  mutes I reassure him pat him on the back  leave aga I ususally  never have to do this me than twice My advice is to go wh your own  stcts because babies will eventually sleep on their own
I believe that parents should review several books regardg child rearg  feedg  choose a philosophy that best sus their personaly  I thoughly enjoyed Gary Ezzo's book  It helped me to establish a route  f my baby yet provided me wh the flexibily that I needed  My  daughter is eleven weeks old  sleeps 9 hours at night  She is obviously  happy as she smiles  coos throughout the day  She almost never fusses   cries   she does I know that she has a legimate need  I am a  person that craves structure  my own le so the fmation provided   this book is very pratical f me  I was not comftable wh dem  feedg because I found  dficult to plan my day  I never knew when my  daughter would want to eat  sleep  I try to keep my daughter on a fairly  consistent schedule but she is able to adjust easily when flexibily   our day is needed  Baby Wise promotes flexibily not rigidy as many  reviewers have repted  Read  yourself  decide   sus your  personaly  Choose which philosophy meets your needs  Happy parents mean  happy children
I found this book to be very confusg  In some places  seems to suggest one thg   another  seems to suggest the oppose  The auth's tone bothered me too  At one pot he describes his cryg  grchild: &quotshe would climb rapidly from a whimper to a wail like an  F-16 headg to the stratosphere&quot  He tells us that f his other  grchild cryg &quotbecame an art fm&quot  In both cases the pot  he made was  was unnecessary to attend to the baby because the cry was  ( his opion) just basically noise ( art I guess)  I have read many  books on parentg  never heard a parentg auth wre  such a  detached way about a baby's cries  He seems to be que compassionate  about adults needg their sleep  about men gettg their wives  attention away from the baby but there is very ltle compassion   understg directed at the ltle F-16 wailg  the crib  There are  many many other wonderful  sightful books on parentg babies  Buy  one of them
A best friend gave this book to me at a baby shower  said &quotIf you don't read anythg else as new parents read this book  It's a godsend!&quot  And she was right  By 6 weeks our son was sleepg 5 to 6  hours befe a 3:00 am feedg  sce 10 weeks has been sleepg 10  to 11 hours a night wh no feedgs  changes  He's such a happy baby   craves his route already at 4 months  These successes didn't happen  overnight by any means  When folks compliment us on our baby's extremely  happy demean I cred Babywise  our hard wk  When asked  our  baby sleeps through the night  I say yes f 10 to 11 hours I hear  &quotOh you're so lucky&quot  I assure them luck had nothg at all to  do wh   Instead there were nights of holdg hs wh my husb   listeng to our baby get through those awake times on his own to learn  to put himself back to sleep all the while tryg to convce ourselves  that we as lovg parents were dog the right thg  Yes yes a  thous times yes we were dog the right thg!  Our son now puts  himself to sleep easily naps regularly  mommy  daddy can leave him  wh a ster knowg he'll pretty much not be a problem at all  And a  fairly strict route has made our lives so much me predictable  Now  when our son does fuss which isn't very often we know that there's a very  valid reason  somethg is truly wrong  No our son  our lives are  far from perfect but we feel much me secure as new parents thanks to the   guidance  Babywise  I always recommend Babywise to anyone I come   contact wh who wonders how they'll ever get their baby to sleep through  the night because  wks   Now I'm off to der Babywise II
A friend of me gave me this book  I have been followg the Babywise they wh a few modications  I followed the book strictly at first  fed my newbn every 3 hours   I must adm my son was sleepg through  the night at 5 weeks ! Although  I tottaly disagree wh puttg your  newbn child to sleep cold  turkey !!! It took hours of cryg to get my  baby to sleep  after beg traumatized he slept beautully all night  I  used Dr Brazelton's they of puttg your child to sleep when they are  realexed  allready que sleepy   they do cry then you comft them  every 3 to 5 mutes   This wked much better f my son ! He is now 4  months  gog to bed is'nt scary  Mommy  Daddy are also happy !  Other than that  I would recommend Baby Wise  There methods f  everythg else like estabilishg a good route is great This book can  be very helpfull  you use your best judgement as a parent
Anyone who tells a mother to igne her God-given stcts  let a baby cry  out f up to an hour has no compassion  understg of what a small baby needs! This book is garbage! Babies don't need to be  &quottraed&quot they need to be loved Ezzo thks parents should fce  schedules on ty babies In other books he also recommends hurtg babies  as young as 6 months old f &quotplayg wh their food&quot
I have just had my third child  this is the first child I have used Baby Wise wh  I must say  was a nice surprise  Havg 2 younger children  the house the book provided guideles to structure the baby's  day so my other 2 were not left high  dry when the baby wakes up   needs to be fed  My baby is 8 weeks old  he sleeps 7-8 hours per night   is very content durg the day  I wish I would have had  f my  first but am certaly glad I had  f my third
I bought this book  tried  va to follow Ezzo's methods wh my first baby  He was  high-need  simply could not f to a 3-hour schedule  sleep through the night as an fant  I left him to cry  several times which went totally agast my natural motherg stcts    never wked anyway-- only left us both cryg  sleep-deprived   made f one very guilty mom  By the time my next baby came along I  had heard about Dr William Sears  he convced me that followg my  stcts is the right thg to do  We now practice co-sleepg  I  breastfeed my daughter to sleep whenever she needs   What  the wld  is wrong wh that???  I now get my sleep  my baby daughter is happy   secure  Ezzo makes parenthood sound like an unpleasant che that you fd  yourself stuck wh  By contrast parentg a child is a great  responsibily that takes lots of time commment  love  If you want  a helpful parentg book wrten by someone who obviously cares about  children buy THE BABY BOOK by Dr Sears--don't waste your money on this  one
Havg majed  Child Development I found this book to be the key to what has been missg from so many relationships between parents  babiesA girlfriend of me mother of tws (that were both breastfed)  recommended the book to me when I was expectg  I knew what wonders   wked  her own le  was eager to read   I loved everythg  had  to say!  It showed how to really pay attention to what your child's needs  are  My baby is 7-months old  is so content  happy! Everywhere we  go we always hear about what a wonderful baby we have  how we are so  lucky  Well  wasn't all luck  A lot of  was followg the program  outled  Baby Wise  makg  wk f both my husb  myself as  well as our daughter  I cannot beg to express what a joy this book is   If you are pregnant read  give  a try!
Wh three graduate degrees between us my husb  I thought we'd figure out new parenthood the same way we figured out everythg -- advice of the experts combed wh stct  As we entered month three of  parentg wh our baby not sleepg ONE HOUR at night (up EVERY night from  7 pm to 5 am)  us rotatg sleep on three-hour shts we were  absolutely despondent  We frantically searched all of our books -- by  pediatricians lactation nurses etc  --  I can't tell you how many  times we read &quotbaby knows best&quot  So we dutully fed on dem  (breast feedg 17 times a day at one pot)  let the baby set the  schedule -- meang there wasn't one  Enter the Baby Wise book -- wh  three days on the Ezzo's schedule our daughter was sleepg through the  night  we were begng to feel human aga!  Even though we were  happier much me imptanly our daughter was a new person --  was   she needed a schedule even me than we did  We customized the schedule to  f our needs but havg guideles to follow really did save our lives   I subsequently bought 50 copies of the book  I h them out to every  parent I meet who mentions that they are coherent from sleep deprivation  An ob/gyn friend also bought dozens of copies to h out to new mothers --  some of whom were comg  wantg Prozac prescriptions when  turned out  me sleep  a baby schedule was all they needed  Let's face  -- no  one can function well on two hours of sleep a night f 60 consecutive  nights   I've had friends whose two  three-year-olds weren't sleepg  through the night another who hired a night-time ster because her baby  (now 2!) has never slept through the night (likes to get up  play  between 2  4 am)  The Ezzos have the guts to say what current child  experts don't -- namely that the boundaries set  not set by the parents  determe how le wh your child will be  I give this book an  A+++++++++++++++++++
After six weeks of applyg Baby Wise prciples to my first-bn son I  threw this book away  The prciples seem logical  I expect some  babies adapt very well to schedules but Baby Wise can be very  UNwiseOne last comment  The Ezzo's characterization of dem-fed  babies  their parents is facile stereotypical  overly negative   They assert that parents who dem feed simply offer the breast rather  than vestigatg the needs of the child  In fact their characterization  implies that parents who dem feed are extremely untelligent  allow  their babies to take over their lives resultg  a &quotbaby as center  of the universe&quot scenario  Creatg unrealistic stereotypes like this  is a po method of argumentation  suggests that the Ezzo's are less  than scientic  their presentation
As a Child Development professional (I'm a parent of two children ages 4  mos  25 years) my we  I found the igal Baby Wise to be a  terric source of parentg advice  The prciples require diligence on  the part of parents (diligence is requirement f any successful parent)  If you love your child ( I'm sure you do!) you owe  to them to be a  lovg leader  your home  This book shows you how to be that lovg  leader from day one of your baby's le  As a Christian 's terestg  to note that the auths have a series entled Growg Children God's Way  which explas the biblical prciples underlyg the secularized Baby Wise  book  My we  I used the igal edion of Baby Wise  the areas  we found confusg  th were happily enough the very areas the auths  revised  the current edion  My firstbn son took four months to sleep  through the nights but my daughter only 7 weeks!  Oh  BTW  you  don't like my credentials as a Child Development professional my we's  credentials are better:  she's a licensed clical social wker wh an  MSW  the State of Flida
I was given this book by a nurse friend who swe by   I used  wh  some modications  I was very nervous at the idea of takg care of a  baby  had no idea what to do  All the other books that I read talked  about dem feedg  no sleep lettg the baby run the show really   This book gives clear-cut directions provides schedules f nap time  playtime feedg  I put my son on a 3 hour feedg schedule (as they had  him on at the hospal where I delivered)   wked fe - at four  months he was 25&quot long  20 lbs  I have heard many cricisms of  this bookmaly regardg babies who were not gettg enough to eat based  on the 3 hour schedule  That can certaly happen though wh all the  charts the book provides f mong poop etc  seems like you would  catch on to a problem pretty quick  I thk you have to take  like  anythg else - I used their guideles but I modied  to su my  family  My son started sleepg through the night at ten weeks  I plan on  purchasg Babywise II now that I've started him on solids  aga  cannot fd clear directions on how much to feed  when
As a Child Development professional I was frightened by this book  It  can only lead to disaster  Placg the young fant on an unnatural  feedg  sleepg schedule damages the breastfeedg relationship    doesn't teach the child to be a better me discipled person  It  teaches them that the wld is a cold hard place where the people he  depends on most durg these helpless times will not respond to his needs   If new  soon to be parents need a resource let them look up Dr Sears   Brazelton
I have a 2 1/2 month old baby who started sleepg through the night at 4  weeks  was sleepg every night f 8-10 hours by week 7!  I had many  friends tell me about the Baby Wise prciples  they are so logical   my baby picked up on a 3 hour route by the second day  It's a must f  new parents  Start early!
Thanks to the recommendations of several friends who had very successfully  used Baby Wise wh their fants we started from day one wh our tws  (who just celebrated their 1st birthday today)  As predicted they are  contented happy secure babies (we contually get comments from others  about how amazg they are)  yes this helped them ( us!!!) to start  sleepg through the night at 10 weeks -- a maj help f parents of  newbns especially tws (le is wonderful when we're all gettg enough  sleep)  And at one year they not only sleep predictably from 8:30pm to 7am  but take good naps  the mng  the afternoon energizg them   givg us predictable blocks of time to take care of other thgs   Babies are such an credible blessg  This past year has been the  best  our lives  I can certaly give Baby Wise some of the cred
People can't stop commentg on what a happy  contented baby we have   This was not the case at about 3 months old  Almost the day we swched to  this method of feedg nappg etc did my baby stop cryg  I have many  friends who have used the Ezzo's approach  you can sure tell when we get  together wh the non-Ezzo babiesthey are almost always cranky tired   unhappy To those crics out therePhooey!  Babies develop their own  schedules anyway even  parents claim that they are dem fed
I was given a copy of Babywise befe my daughter was bn   seemed  like a practical approach  However when she actually arrived she was  hungry me than every three hours ( yes the milk supply was fe)   an extremely light sleeper  Had we let her cry herself back to sleep each  time she awakened we would have been completely exhausted listeng to  her  What this book doesn't mention is that babies go through phases--what  doesn't wk  the first few weeks may easily wk later  When she was  about ne weeks old she suddenly put herself on the three hour  feed/wake/sleep schedule the book recommends  I am convced that she just  needed to mature  She doesn't sleep through the night yet but even this  book cannot offer guarantees  Sleepg through the night isn't a stard  by which parentg is judged--'s simply a product of a child's readess  to do so
I have 2 children under 2 who have been raised on babywise Everyone tells  me how lucky I am to have such &quoteasy' babies They both slept through  the night by eight weeks  were nursed 5+ mos each My daughter almost  never had to cry herself to sleep I thk the key to the success is the  sleep-eat-wake cycle I recommend these books to everyone!! I am a MUCH  better mom to my babies after a full nights sleep
Although some people believe Babywise is the wrong way to go this book helped us tremendously  A couple friends recommended  who had great success wh   We started when our baby was 18 weeks old  It was a ltle hard to let him cry at first but  ended wh a few days  he was able to go to bed whout beg nursed to sleep  He qu wakg  the middle of the night at the same time - so we all got better sleep!  And I was able to figure out when he was truly hungry  I was so used to givg him my breast everytime he cried  was wearg me outI can honestly say my baby is happy well adjusted  I do hold him  cuddle him ! despe what some people thk the book implies  You don't have to follow  to the pot where you're legalistic  rigid  I used  as a guidele  I'm glad I did
All parents should know that this book  s sequel are full of advice that leadg pediatricians  parentg specialists reject While some parents have had success wh the program  can lead to malnourished listless unhappy babies In addion the auth of Babywise has manipulated scientic studies to su his purposes In many cases these studies were authed by people who have publicly spoken out agast the Babywise advice The list of pediatricians  &quotparentg professionals&quot who recommend the books has also been manipulated Some of the people on  have not read the books  disapprove of s contents F an -depth analysis of the dangerous practices of this book read the article  the Mothers column of the onle magaze Salon at [] You can do a search  the archives by the date of the article 8/6/98 The tle of the article is &quotGettg Wise to Babywise&quot
This book provided me wh a &quotgame plan&quot f how I would hle my precious baby once we arrived at home  I returned to my teachg job eight weeks after my daughter's birth   was a wonderful treat to have her sleepg through the night when I was very much needg a good night's sleep It was great to share this book wh my husb  my mother who watches my daughter durg the school day  It has given my daughter a consistent  lovg environment  which to grow!
Bucknum probably studied physiology but doesn't seem to remember that  ought to apply to nursg mothers  that child development applies to babies  If you follow the Christian (but not scriptural) based ideas of this book you may see a FTT baby- one who has learned that no matter what s/he signals her needs will rarely be met  This applies to feedg sleep cuddlg beg carried beg talked to  (Ezzo says we aren't primive people so our babies don't need a lot of holdg  slg/snuggly use) They also claim there is no &quotmaternal stct&quot but they do all they can to obscure the stct we mothers know we have  The baby is viewed as a m convenience but a &quotjoy&quot (how they don't exple) whereas the parents are the only truly imptant family members  This is the secular version of &quotPreparation f Parentg&quot a Christian program repudiated by many churches  It doesn't wk  although Ezzo likes to thk so J! esus wasn't raised this way  Oh  appears to wk  you want a baby who sleeps plays  eats on cue but is unable to determe his  her own bodily needs  Read the Sears new Christian parentg book stead  any of their books  you aren't Christian  Penelope Leach  (The religious affiliation is not revealed  Becomg Baby(un)wise)  There are too many good books to waste your money on this one  Bucknum often doesn't recommend this method to his patients- maybe he knows somethg he won't adm  prt  :-/
I bought this book when my daughter was 7 weeks old  at 10 weeks she was sleepg through the night!  As a first time parent  never beg around children I had no idea what a schedule could do f a baby I am a firm believer  Babywise  recommend  to all new parents ( is now my top baby shower present f all expectg mothers)
As a first-time parent who was told repeatedly that dem-feedg was the only lovg option I reluctantly read this book  desperation  This is the first ( only) book that I read that provided some basic guideles  suggestions f scheduled feedg  It was a welcome voice  the dark  helped me get started on the road back from sleep deprivation   As wh all parentg advice  should be adjusted to su your  your child's own needs  The auths promise a great deal  parents should not be disappoted  they do not achieve miracles  However this is an extremely helpful book  f parents  children who do not thrive on dem feedg
This book was hed to me by a friend when I was pregnant  I am now derg  f one of my friends who is pregnant  This book makes sense  It is not radical extreme  rigid  It is simple common sense  I attribute the happiest time  my le these past 6 months wh my baby to this book  It gave me confidence as a first time mother  My baby is happy  I am happy  My husb is happy  My daughter has been sleepg through the night sce she was 7 weeks old  I am rested  thoughly enjoyg her fancy  I loved this book!
I live  Zurich Swzerl  received the german translation of the book from my sister--law befe the birth of our first daughter Tanja Here  Europe feedg on dem is recommended  all the birth classes So even though I found the book reasonable I wasn't sure   would wk but I still decided to give  a try It really did wk Tanja slept through the night after 6 weeks  I have never ever gotten up at night sce! She is a happy kd baby  I am a happy mother who gets enough sleep  am still fully breastfeedg We are grateful to have heard about this method  recommend  to anyone
I received this book f a shower  at first thought  made some sense to establish a route f a new family  not a schedule The carrot dangled  front of new parents is a guarantee of sleepg through the night by 8 weeks All I accomplished from readg this book was loss: loss of my milk supply  loss of self-esteem My baby did sleep through the night by 8 weeks but by that time she had to be supplemented by fmula This book teaches you not to trust your own stcts that children are demons who need your guidance not to develop to even wse spoiled brats  that babies should be a m convenience  your le Because I could not st to let a ty baby cry I made Ezzo's &quotrules&quot me flexible but still felt like I had to watch the clock  felt terribly guilty every time I fed the baby 15 mutes early I later read several cricisms of the method by lactation consultants who said that many babies whose mothers used the system had similar dficulties I would encourage anyone considerg this book to look up Ezzo on the ternet  fd out how controversial this is  how his own church has denounced his methods Ask yourself&quotHow does this man know that God wants me to put my child on a schedule?&quot My advice trust your stcts  buy William Sears' The Baby Book breastfeed on dem  wry about spoilg later Your baby will sleep through the night soon enough
This book was recommended to us by many people but one couple i was really impressed wh said that their first two were not 'babywise' babies  their second two werethey said the dferences  their 'babywise' children are phenomenol--sleepg through the night was a given but also wh their mal foundation that they developed much quicker than the first two  We  have an 11 month old who began sleepg through the night at 5 1/2 weeksWe were not 'rigid' wh what  said but  helped us keep our sany  brought peace to our householdwe  know about what he is dog whether he's wh  his grparents  a ster  the few days a week that I wkhe has regular nap  bedtimes   isn't a problemWe were defete novices at parentgI highly recommend at least readg this book  givg  a try f at least the first book!!!  We are usg the second book now  5-15 months  really enjoy 's guideles  Havg suppt is very helpful  Keep  contact wh other Babywise families f questions  suppt  Then educate a new parent after your success!!  ALSO try Growg Kids God's Way through a large church---same auth  fmat---wh a me church-iented focusI thk there is also a suppt/helple cluded wh that programI know there is a video/discussion group f that which would have been helpful---we saw  afterwards   Lastly we have many friends who did this  many who didn'tthe 'babywisers' are peaceful f the most part (besides teethg  nmal stuff)  many of the others had a harder timeSome still aren't sleepg thru the night etc  We heard some crisism but as far as I'm concerned--- has been very successful f all Babywisers we know   a't broke don't fix  :)!!
Babywise provides excellant direction  settg up a household f a new fant whout loosg se of the priy of marriage  Unlike today's conventional wisedom babywise reflects back on tradional structure wh the home where a child adds to the family but does not become the primary focus of the family  The auths offer proven ideas on establishg feedg schedules daily routes  successful nighttime sleepg  My child  others successful began sleepg through the night at 12 weeks after followg this program  I suggest usg  as a &quotguidele&quot to establishg your own family route  As wh all child rearg books - you pick  choose what fmation fs your lestyle
