@thehill @SenRickScott Did he also discuss how to defraud Medicare? #skeletor
@SenateGOP This is laughable. You guys have done everything in your power to support Russia. Remember that luncheon you’ll went to on July 4th??? We haven’t forgotten. @cnn @msnbc #traitors #treason

"@RishiSunak Can you find the £4.3 billion stolen in covid fraud from the covid loan scheme you designed please?  I’m sure our country would like to do much more than £40 million.  Thanks.  Btw, how was the #DowningStreetParty questionnaire?"
@DeborahMeaden @BruceHenderson2 We've been in the dust of the EU ever since #UkraineCrisis began.

"@PippaCrerar Much like Johnson with #DowningStreetParties   One wasn't enough, they had to break the law at a dozen or so 🤷‍♂️"

"@theGrit_music I find the whole process of making such a decision without consulting the other nations of our union to be disrespectful, and of course dangerous.  #indyref2 is just a question of time.  And I wouldn’t blame any of the devolved nations if they didn’t want to stick around."
@RhonddaBryant @trussliz What could possibly be distracting them?  #DowningStreetParties

"@devisridhar At what point does a Prime Minister who ignores scientific advice endangering people's health and lives, move from ignorant bad decision making to cover up #DowningSteetParties to being a danger to pubic safety?"
"@Dr2NisreenAlwan This whole thing is crazy.  But we should remember they are to distract from #DowningStreetParties   There’s no science behind it, just a diversion."
"@theGrit_music @SirRogerGale Exactly this.  Johnson has been a disaster throughout, and increasingly worse in recent weeks, more so when trying to deflect from breaking his own lockdown rules #DowningStreetParties   But instead of acting to protect our nation, they let him tear it apart."

@alandrummond2 @fordnation Exactly. Fully vaccinated should mean 3 doses now (2 doses plus booster). Canada is at only 55% of eligible &gt;18 years having had Booster. Need higher Booster numbers #Ontario and #Canada! #GetVaccinatedAndBoosted #WearAMask #covid19 #Omicron #omicronba2 variant. Be smart.
@alandrummond2 @JulieMDPanneton 💔U see ER🆘 I am concerned about ON-Doug Ford relaxing restrictions too fast (again).

@talk2oleary Pure American. Pure Republican tRump #RightWing #America playbook. Tamara Lich &amp; her convoy hardcore truckers so linked with USA sources.

Which Canadian political leaders, which chief medical health officers publicly stressed that #N95 masks can prevent, diminish influenza spread?  Also current year influenza vaccine reportedly a dud."
@savoirfaire_2 @MickSweetman @CDCofBC @Fraserhealth The deadly pandemic &amp; long Covid should be the priority. An acknowledgment by Bonnie Henry @CDCofBC that #COVIDisAirborne with airborne virus protection measures in place. #N95Masks for public indoor spaces &amp; transit is what responsible health leadership looks like.
@savoirfaire_2 @MickSweetman @CDCofBC @Fraserhealth The excess doses can be offered as 4th doses to elderly &amp; front line medical staff.  Or they can expire &amp; be thrown out.  Is #BonnieHenry priority to protect BCers?  Yes or no?  #bcpoli #bced

@chrisgailus Wearing masks such as #N95  quality when indoors with others outside one's household prevent the spread of the virus for both the vaxxed &amp; unvaxxed. Yet Bonnie ditched this safety measure. BCers deserve better than Bonnie &amp; her parrots.  #bcpoli  #bced  #COVIDisAirborne
@NightShiftMD Certainly not wearing one in indoor spaces or transit outside one's household is fueling the rapid spread of the virus.  #onpoli #abpoli #bcpoli #topoli #vanpoli
@richardzussman @jana_thorn The numbers are a sham as most BCers refused an official PCR test. Hospitalization numbers misleading because when they test negative but renain in hospital they are removed from the numbers made public.  #bcpoli #bced
@DebraJ43 @richardzussman You get a whole litre of sanitizer free. But only if everyone is maskless &amp; spreading #COVID19 and TB around. BC's contribution to inclusion. Of bacterium &amp; viruses of course.

@richardzussman It's not independent if the government is initiating the review.  #COVIDisAirborne This has been  known since early 2020. Masks work especially well fit #N95 ones. Schools are unsafe and a major spread location of the virus.  #bced #bcpoli

@elonmusk @aginnt There are no counter protests because there is a very contagious pandemic. Those who would protest are keeping themselves and their loved ones safe. They are expressing their disgust online - see #GoHomeTruckers etc There would also be climate protests but for the pandemic.

@TristanSnell @guapofalbq Seize RRRRRRets of all Russians potentially RRRRRRociated with Putin.  Let them present their defenses in court and western nations can apologize for the few mistakes made later.  Make Putin’s allies suffer for his actions so they throw him out.  #SeizeChelsea

"@BlackKnight10k Positive visualization: 1) Ukraine defenders demolishing attackers 2) Disgust in Russia creating democratic uprising, toppling Putin from power 3) Navalny replacing him to lead Russia to peace &amp; prosperity with its neighbors! 4) US voters abandon #TraitorTrump &amp; his GQP!"

@DrEricDing @ZelenskyyUa Remarkable human being. Pure admiration for this man. #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦
@lapatina_ I would LOVE IT if #Ukraine would send a few missiles in the direction of #RussianOilAndGas pipelines. That would REALLY #ShutdownPutin and maybe the world would FINALLY learn to live with #CleanEnergy and #ShutdownOligarchs. Are there any friendly #RussianMilitary around there?
@OccupyDemocrats I will do everything I humbly can to make people aware of the horrendous actions of #Putin. Please do the same #IStandWithUkriane https://t.co/X0nxn3HYzQ

@olex_scherba Oh My! A sea of people standing up for Ukraine. The resilience of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians are providing more impetus for the world to #StandWithUkriane
@jkenney Jason   Is this why you tried to seduce and bring in the Saudi Arabian regime and played footsie with the Russians to infiltrate the Alberta oil sands over the last 2-years?  The truth shows us who you REALLY are and who you bend the knee for; What else are you hiding? #Ableg https://t.co/DBYjTou65N
@SamRamani2 Can they wipe out that 3 mile long caravan reported 30 miles south of Kyiv on their way? Asking for a Ukrainian friend. #StandWithUkriane   🇺🇦💙💛🇺🇦

@RhonddaBryant @JosieSlater15 I also support the UK rejoining the EU. Have a word with Starmer please Chris? It's ridiculous calling for another country to join the EU whilst opposing our own membership. #Brexit #EU #Ukraine
"@KwasiKwarteng YOU are much reliant on Scotland though, correct?  Can we expect to hear the same lines that a previous #corrupt Tory PM leader when he said Scottish Oil is for the broad shoulders of the UK (to steal)?"
"@IAPonomarenko #Russia is also playing a Double Game with #Ukraine: • The Head of the Russian delegation is saying ""We Stand With Peace"" but is not acknowledging why #Russianforces firstly have invaded on Ukraine? • Russia wants to fool the world in the name of negotiations.

@nathaliejacoby1 Rubio is hiding because Russians sent him $1.5 MILLION. Marco hopes nobody finds out. I live in TN and I send $ to help Val Demings defeat Little Marco. We can flip another Senate seat to blue by helping Val. #ValNotMarco #ValDemings #Florida https://t.co/bjprSS2iWw
