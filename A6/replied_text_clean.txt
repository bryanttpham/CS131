pippacrerar
so
sunak
creates
a
scheme
resulting
in
billions
in
covid
loans
stolen
then
writes
off
£43
billion
of
taxpayers
money
and
he
broke
the
law
attending
at
least
one
of
the
many
downingstreetparties

pippacrerar
much
like
johnson
with
downingstreetparties
one
wasnt
enough
they
had
to
break
the

at
a
dozen
or
so
🤷‍♂️

find

endangering

move

bad

making

cover
up
downingsteetparties
to
being
a
danger
to

safety
dr2nisreenalwan
this
whole
thing
is
crazy
but
we
should
remember
they
are
to
distract
from
downingstreetparties
there’s
no
science
behind
it
just
a
diversion

sirrogergale
exactly
this
johnson
has
been
a

throughout

increasingly
worse
in

more

that

applaud
the

this

theheraldsun
whilst
there

there
is
a

indifference
towards

a

russia
is
also
playing
a
double

with

•
the
head
of
the

is
saying
we
stand

but
is
not
acknowledging
why

firstly
have
invaded
